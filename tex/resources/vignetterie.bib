  abstract = {1. The purpose of the expeditions was to determine what effect, if any, is produced by a gravitational field on the path of a ray of light traversing it. Apart from possible surprises, there appeared to be three alternatives, which it was especially desired to discriminate between— (1) The path is uninfluenced by gravitation. (2) The energy or mass of light is subject to gravitation in the same way as ordinary matter. If the law of gravitation is strictly the Newtonian law, this leads to an apparent displacement of a star close to the sun’s limb amounting to 0"·87 outwards. (3) The course of a, ray of light is in accordance with Einstein’s generalised relativity theory. This leads to an apparent displacement of a star at the limb amounting to 1"·75 outwards. In either of the last two cases the displacement is inversely proportional to the distance of the star from the sun’s centre, the displacement under (3) being just double the displacement under (2).},

  abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of robust self-assembly and repair capabilities of complex systems would have enormous implications for basic evolutionary developmental biology as well as for transformative applications in regenerative biomedicine and the engineering of highly fault-tolerant cybernetic systems. Molecular biologists are working to identify the pathways underlying the remarkable regenerative abilities of model species that perfectly regenerate limbs, brains, and other complex body parts. However, a profound disconnect remains between the deluge of high-resolution genetic and protein data on pathways required for regeneration, and the desired spatial, algorithmic models that show how self-monitoring and growth control arise from the synthesis of cellular activities. This barrier to progress in the understanding of morphogenetic controls may be breached by powerful techniques from the computational sciences—using non-traditional modeling approaches to reverse-engineer systems such as planaria: flatworms with a complex bodyplan and nervous system that are able to regenerate any body part after traumatic injury. Currently, the involvement of experts from outside of molecular genetics is hampered by the specialist literature of molecular developmental biology: impactful collaborations across such different fields require that review literature be available that presents the key functional capabilities of important biological model systems while abstracting away from the often irrelevant and confusing details of specific genes and proteins. To facilitate modeling efforts by computer scientists, physicists, engineers, and mathematicians, we present a different kind of review of planarian regeneration. Focusing on the main patterning properties of this system, we review what is known about the signal exchanges that occur during regenerative repair in planaria and the cellular mechanisms that are thought to underlie them. By establishing an engineering-like style for reviews of the molecular developmental biology of biomedically important model systems, significant fresh insights and quantitative computational models will be developed by new collaborations between biology and the information sciences.},

  url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Free_abelian_group&oldid=951699710},
  abstract = {In mathematics, a free abelian group or free Z-module is an abelian group with a basis, or, equivalently, a free module over the integers. Being an abelian group means that it is a set with an addition operation that is associative, commutative, and invertible. A basis is a subset such that every element of the group can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of basis elements with integer coefficients. For instance, the integers with addition form a free abelian group with basis \{1\}. Free abelian groups have properties which make them similar to vector spaces. They have applications in algebraic topology, where they are used to define chain groups, and in algebraic geometry, where they are used to define divisors.  Integer lattices also form examples of free abelian groups, and lattice theory studies free abelian subgroups of real vector spaces. The elements of a free abelian group with basis B may be described in several equivalent ways. These include formal sums over B, which are expressions of the form                         ∑                    a                        i                                        b                        i                                     \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash sum a\_\{i\}b\_\{i\}\}    where each coefficient ai is a nonzero integer, each factor  bi is a distinct basis element, and the sum has finitely many terms. Alternatively, the elements of a free abelian group may be thought of as signed multisets containing finitely many elements of B, with the multiplicity of an element in the multiset equal to its coefficient in the formal sum.  Another way to represent an element of a free abelian group is as a function from B to the integers with finitely many nonzero values; for this functional representation, the group operation is the pointwise addition of functions. Every set B has a free abelian group with B as its basis. This group is unique in the sense that every two free abelian groups with the same basis are isomorphic. Instead of constructing it by describing its individual elements, a free group with basis B may be constructed as a direct sum of copies of the additive group of the integers, with one copy per member of B. Alternatively, the free abelian group with basis B may be described by a presentation with the elements of B as its generators and with the commutators of pairs of members as its relators. The rank of a free abelian group is the cardinality of a basis; every two bases for the same group give the same rank, and every two free abelian groups with the same rank are isomorphic. Every subgroup of a free abelian group is itself free abelian; this fact allows a general abelian group to be understood as a quotient of a free abelian group by "relations", or as a cokernel of an injective homomorphism between free abelian groups. The only free abelian groups that are free groups are the trivial group and the infinite cyclic group.},

Its network has 458 stations and a track length of 1,501 km (933 mi) making it the largest suburban railway network in the country, and also one of the largest in the world. There are five main lines and 19 branch lines. It operates more than 1,500 services, carrying 3.5 million people daily and 1.2 billion people annually. It runs from IST 03:00 am until 02:00 am approximately and fares range from Rs.5 to Rs.25. The system is electrified with 25 kV 50 Hz AC overhead line and runs on 5 ft 6 in (1,676 mm) broad gauge track. It has interchange stations with the Kolkata Metro at various locations. The Kolkata Suburban Railway is part of the second passenger railway constructed in British India during the mid 19th century. The first train ran between Howrah and Hooghly stations. A hundred years after the initial run, EMU services began. The system is operated by two zones of Indian Railways; Eastern and South Eastern zones. These zones are further divided into railway divisions of Howrah and Sealdah in ER and Kharagpur in SER. Howrah, Sealdah and Kolkata railway station are the three major terminals serving the network in the city. Shalimar and Santragachi Junction are also two major termini stations for mail/express trains as well as passenger/fast passenger trains.},

I end by discussing aspects of complexity theory itself that could benefit from philosophical analysis.},

  abstract = {In recent years a doctrine known as ontic structural realism (OSR) has achieved a degree of notoriety, but many people remain confused as to what exactly the doctrine amounts. In this paper three main variants of OSR are defined and discussed: (i) OSR1, which is the view that relations are ontologically primitive but objects and properties are not; (ii) OSR2, which is the view that objects and relations are ontologically primitive but properties are not; (iii) OSR3, which is the view that properties and relations are ontologically primitive but objects are not. Proponents of OSR claim that it is a “naturalistic” metaphysics, arguing that metaphysical views that take objects and/or properties as ontologically primitive are undermined by contemporary physics. In this paper it is argued that OSR1 and OSR2 are themselves undermined by contemporary physics. On the other hand, it is also argued that considerations about the objects of quantum mechanics and general relativity do seem to suggest that we should abandon some of our “common-sense” metaphysical intuitions, and that OSR3 is one of the metaphysical views that is compatible with what these theories seem to tell us about fundamental ontology.},

Microbes may do this through two potential strategies: (i) generating cravings for foods that they specialize on or foods that suppress their competitors, or (ii) inducing dysphoria until we eat foods that enhance their fitness. We review several potential mechanisms for microbial control over eating behavior including microbial influence on reward and satiety pathways, production of toxins that alter mood, changes to receptors including taste receptors, and hijacking of the vagus nerve, the neural axis between the gut and the brain. We also review the evidence for alternative explanations for cravings and unhealthy eating behavior. Because microbiota are easily manipulatable by prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics, fecal transplants, and dietary changes, altering our microbiota offers a tractable approach to otherwise intractable problems of obesity and unhealthy eating.},

We find that these values for G are oscillatory in nature, with a period of , an amplitude of , and mean-value crossings in 1994 and 1997. However, we do not suggest that G is actually varying by this much, this quickly, but instead that something in the measurement process varies. Of other recently reported results, to the best of our knowledge, the only measurement with the same period and phase is the Length of Day (LOD —defined as a frequency measurement such that a positive increase in LOD values means slower Earth rotation rates and therefore longer days). The aforementioned period is also about half of a solar activity cycle, but the correlation is far less convincing. The 5.9 year periodic signal in LOD has previously been interpreted as due to fluid core motions and inner-core coupling. We report the G/LOD correlation, whose statistical significance is 0.99764 assuming no difference in phase, without claiming to have any satisfactory explanation for it. Least unlikely, perhaps, are currents in the Earth's fluid core that change both its moment of inertia (affecting LOD) and the circumstances in which the Earth-based experiments measure G. In this case, there might be correlations with terrestrial-magnetic-field measurements.},

  abstract = {Background The global burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is forecast to increase, and anticoagulants will remain important medicines for its management. Coroners’ Prevention of Future Death reports (PFDs) provide valuable insights that may enable safer and more effective use of these agents. Aim To identify CVD-related PFDs involving anticoagulants. Design and Setting Retrospective observational study of coronial case reports in England and Wales between 2013 and 2019. Method We screened 3037 PFDs for eligibility and included PFDs where CVD and an anticoagulant caused or contributed to the death. We descriptively analysed included cases and used content analysis to assess concerns raised by coroners and who responded to them. Results We identified 113 cardiovascular disease-related PFDs involving anticoagulants. Warfarin (36\%), enoxaparin (11\%), and rivaroxaban (11\%) were the most common anticoagulants reported. Concerns most frequently raised by coroners included poor systems (31\%), poor communication (25\%), and failures to keep accurate medical records (25\%). These concerns were most often directed to NHS trusts (29\%), hospitals (10\%), and general practices (8\%). Nearly two-thirds (60\%) of PFDs had not received responses from such organisations, which are mandatory under regulation 28 of the Coroners’ (Investigations) Regulations 2013. We created a publicly available tool, https://preventabledeathstracker.net/, which displays coroners’ reports in England and Wales to streamline access and identify important lessons to prevent future deaths. Conclusion National organisations, healthcare professionals, and prescribers should take actions to address the concerns of coroners’ in PFDs to improve the safe use of anticoagulants in patients with cardiovascular disease. How this fits in A previous assessment of 500 PFDs identified anticoagulants as the class of drugs most often involved in fatal medication errors. This study uses innovative methods to automatically collect all available PFDs between 2013 and 2019 to identify deaths from cardiovascular disease when the use of or lack of anticoagulants caused or contributed to the death. Coroners’ raised hundreds of coroners in their reports, including issues with communication, following protocols, education and training, access to resources, and safety. Despite repeat concerns with national relevance being identified, most CVD-anticoagulant PFDs were sent locally to NHS Trusts, hospitals, and general practices, limiting their ability to reduce harms and prevent premature deaths.},

However, it is often overlooked in modern scholarship, despite being associated with leading figures such as Francis Bacon, Robert Boyle, Isaac Newton, Jean Le Rond d'Alembert, David Hume and Christian Wolff. Ranging from the early Royal Society of London in the seventeenth century to the uptake of experimental philosophy in Paris and Berlin in the eighteenth, this book provides new terms of reference for understanding early modern philosophy and science, and its eventual eclipse in the shadow of post-Kantian notions of empiricism and rationalism. Experimental Philosophy and the Origins of Empiricism is an integrated history of early modern experimental philosophy which challenges the rationalism and empiricism historiography that has dominated Anglophone history of philosophy for more than a century.},

  abstract = {A number of authors have objected to the application of non-classical logic to problems in philosophy on the basis that these non-classical logics are usually characterised by a classical metatheory. In many cases the problem amounts to more than just a discrepancy; the very phenomena responsible for non-classicality occur in the field of semantics as much as they do elsewhere. The phenomena of higher order vagueness and the revenge liar are just two such examples. The aim of this paper is to show that a large class of non-classical logics are strong enough to formulate their own model theory in a corresponding non-classical set theory. Specifically I show that adequate definitions of validity can be given for the propositional calculus in such a way that the metatheory proves, in the specified logic, that every theorem of the propositional fragment of that logic is validated. It is shown that in some cases it may fail to be a classical matter whether a given sentence is valid or not. One surprising conclusion for non-classical accounts of vagueness is drawn: there can be no axiomatic, and therefore precise, system which is determinately sound and complete.},

On that view, to solve the paradoxes of vagueness we need to investigate the nature of words like ‘heap’ and ‘bald’. This book criticizes linguistic explanations of the state of ignorance we find ourselves in when confronted with borderline cases and develops, within the framework of classical logic, a theory of propositional vagueness in its stead. The view places the study of vagueness squarely in epistemological terms, situating it within a theory of rational propositional attitudes. Once one has accepted vague propositions, a number of questions about their role in thought become conspicuous. Can one’s total evidence be vague? What sort of support does vague evidence lend to precise matters and conversely? Can rational people agree about the precise whilst disagreeing about the vague? Is it rational to care intrinsically about vague matters? Can one’s attitudes towards vague propositions be relevant in decision making? The book develops a set of positions on these matters, and exploits them in expounding a novel theory of vagueness in which vagueness is defined in terms of its role in thought. The resulting view is applied to a number of problems in the philosophy of vagueness.},

I first outline a definitional account of ontic vagueness – one that I think is an improvement on previous attempts because it remains neutral on other, independent metaphysical issues. I then develop one potential manifestation of that basic definitional structure. This is a more robust (and much less neutral) account which gives a fully classical explication of ontic vagueness via modal concepts. The overarching aim is to systematically investigate the puzzling question of what exactly it could be for the world itself to be vague.},

In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyper links. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web. IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.},

I argue that Williamson's anti-luminosity argument succeeds only if one assumes that, even in the limit of ideal reflection, the obtaining of the condition in question and one's beliefs about that condition can be radically disjoint from one another. However, no self-respecting defender of the luminosity of the mental would ever make such an assumption. Thus Williamson can only secure his controversial claims in epistemology by taking for granted certain equally controversial claims in the philosophy of mind. What emerges is that the best bet for defending an internalist epistemology against Williamson's attack is to take there to be a tight, intimate connection between (to take one example) our experiences and our beliefs upon reflection about the obtaining of those experiences, or between (to take another example) the rationality of our beliefs and our beliefs upon reflection about the rationality of those beliefs.},

It isn’t a causal claim either, at least ifby causation we mean what we normally mean when we use theterm. The causes of the strike concern not the picketing of thetruckers but, instead, antecedent events such as how their employerhas allotted payroll deductions and benefits. Finally, the claimisn’t purely modal in character either—it isn’tmerely the claim that there is a necessary connection betweenpicketing and striking. Perhaps this behavior together with thesatisfaction of other conditions suffices for there to be a laborstrike, but the former suffices for any number of things, such as thefact that 2+2=42+2=42+2=4.},

  abstract = {Consciousness is a mongrel concept: there are a number of very different “consciousnesses.” Phenomenal consciousness is experience; the phenomenally conscious aspect of a state is what it is like to be in that state. The mark of access-consciousness, by contrast, is availability for use in reasoning and rationally guiding speech and action. These concepts are often partly or totally conflated, with bad results. This target article uses as an example a form of reasoning about a function of “consciousness” based on the phenomenon of blindsight. Some information about stimuli in the blind field is represented in the brains of blindsight patients, as shown by their correct “guesses.” They cannot harness this information in the service of action, however, and this is said to show that a function of phenomenal consciousness is somehow to enable information represented in the brain to guide action. But stimuli in the blind field are both access-unconscious and phenomenally unconscious. The fallacy is: an obvious function of the machinery of accessconsciousness is illicitly transferred to phenomenal consciousness.},

  abstract = {Tyler Burge has produced groundbreaking work on the semantics of proper names and indexicals, de re belief, formal truth theories, semantic and epistemic paradoxes, the philosophy of Gottlob Frege, and other areas of the philosophy of language and of mind. But he is best known for his arguments for anti-individualism, or externalism about mental content. Burge's aim in pursuing anti-individualism is nothing less than the solution to some of the most trenchant metaphysical and epistemological problems, including the nature of objectivity and norms, the force of skeptical arguments, apriority, and the nature of the self. Central to all of these is an account of intentional content that includes a penetrating critique of the empiricist notion of a concept.This book focuses mainly on Burge's work on anti-individualism. In it, various philosophers either comment on Burge's work or relate it to their own. An unusual feature is the generosity—both in volume and content—of Burge's contribution to this philosophical conversation. The section containing his responses comprises the most sustained, detailed, and interconnected body of writing that he has published in one place.},

Altered gut microbial ecosystems have been associated with increased metabolic and immune disorders in animals and humans. Molecular interactions linking the gut microbiota with host energy metabolism, lipid accumulation, and immunity have also been identified. However, the exact mechanisms that link specific variations in the composition of the gut microbiota with the development of obesity and metabolic diseases in humans remain obscure owing to the complex etiology of these pathologies. In this review, we discuss current knowledge about the mechanistic interactions between the gut microbiota, host energy metabolism, and the host immune system in the context of obesity and metabolic disease, with a focus on the importance of the axis that links gut microbes and host metabolic inflammation. Finally, we discuss therapeutic approaches aimed at reshaping the gut microbial ecosystem to regulate obesity and related pathologies, as well as the challenges that remain in this area.},

Contextualists support their view by appeal to our intuitions about when it's correct (or incorrect) to ascribe knowledge. Someone might argue that some of these intuitions merely reflect when it is conversationally appropriate to ascribe knowledge, not when knowledge is truly ascribed, and so try to accommodate these intuitions even on an invariantist view. DeRose (Blackwell Guide to Epistemology, 1998; Philosophical Review, 2002) argues that any such 'warranted assertibility manoeuvre', or 'WAM', against contextualism is unlikely to succeed. Here, I argue that his objections to a WAM against contextualism are not persuasive and offer a pragmatic account of the data about ascriptions of knowledge.},

The human gut microbiome and its role in both health and disease has been the subject of extensive research, establishing its involvement in human metabolism, nutrition, physiology, and immune function. Imbalance of the normal gut microbiota have been linked with gastrointestinal conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and wider systemic manifestations of disease such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and atopy. In the first part of this review, we evaluate our evolving knowledge of the development, complexity, and functionality of the healthy gut microbiota, and the ways in which the microbial community is perturbed in dysbiotic disease states; the second part of this review covers the role of interventions that have been shown to modulate and stabilize the gut microbiota and also to restore it to its healthy composition from the dysbiotic states seen in IBS, IBD, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and atopy.},

  abstract = {"Model theory is used in every theoretical branch of analytic philosophy: in philosophy of mathematics, in philosophy of science, in philosophy of language, in philosophical logic, and in metaphysics. But these wide-ranging uses of model theory have created a highly fragmented literature. On the one hand, many philosophically significant results are found only in mathematics textbooks: these are aimed squarely at mathematicians; they typically presuppose that the reader has a serious background in mathematics; and little clue is given as to their philosophical significance. On the other hand, the philosophical applications of these results are scattered across disconnected pockets of papers. The first aim of this book, then, is to explore the philosophical uses of model theory, focusing on the central topics of reference, realism, and doxology. Its second aim is to address important questions in the philosophy of model theory, such as: sameness of theories and structure, the boundaries of logic, and the classification of mathematical structures. Philosophy and Model Theory will be accessible to anyone who has completed an introductory logic course. It does not assume that readers have encountered model theory before, but starts right at the beginning, discussing philosophical issues that arise even with conceptually basic model theory. Moreover, the book is largely self-contained: model-theoretic notions are defined as and when they are needed for the philosophical discussion, and many of the most philosophically significant results are given accessible proofs."-- Preface, page [v]},

Patients frequently reported that they heard a voice "speaking when I speak" and often attributed this "other" voice to an external agent: "I think it's an evil spirit speaking when I speak." The frequency of making these ”other”attributions was significantly related to degree of pitch distortion (rho = 0.62, P {$<$}.01) and to current severity of delusions (rho = 0.62, P {$<$}.01). However, the relationship with hallucinations was not significant (rho = 0.40) and there was no relationship with negative features such as psychomotor retardation. We conclude that the "hallucination-like" reports elicited by our paradigm resulted from an interaction between an unusual perceptual experience (distorted auditory feedback) and an abnormal mechanism for belief formation present in deluded patients. This formulation suggests a close relationship between delusions and hallucinations.},

  abstract = {A Treatise of Human Nature opens with ambitious hopes for the science of man, but Hume eventually launches into a series of skeptical arguments that culminates in a report of radical skeptical despair. This essay is a preliminary exploration of how to interpret this surprising development. I first distinguish two kinds of surprise twist: those that are incompatible with some preceding portion of the work, and those that are not. This suggests two corresponding pictures of Hume. On one picture, he believed the skeptical development to be at odds with something in early Treatise; on the other, he took these two portions of Book 1 to be perfectly compatible. After defending the claim that Hume endorsed both of these portions, I sketch two promising interpretations—a “perspectivist,” incompatibilist interpretation and a “post-skeptical,” compatibilist interpretation—and offer some reasons to favor the latter view.},

  abstract = {The gut-brain axis (GBA) consists of bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous system, linking emotional and cognitive centers of the brain with peripheral intestinal functions. Recent advances in research have described the importance of gut microbiota in influencing these interactions. This interaction between microbiota and GBA appears to be bidirectional, namely through signaling from gut-microbiota to brain and from brain to gut-microbiota by means of neural, endocrine, immune, and humoral links. In this review we summarize the available evidence supporting the existence of these interactions, as well as the possible pathophysiological mechanisms involved. Most of the data have been acquired using technical strategies consisting in germ-free animal models, probiotics, antibiotics, and infection studies. In clinical practice, evidence of microbiota-GBA interactions comes from the association of dysbiosis with central nervous disorders (i.e. autism, anxiety-depressive behaviors) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. In particular, irritable bowel syndrome can be considered an example of the disruption of these complex relationships, and a better understanding of these alterations might provide new targeted therapies.},

  date = {2018-03},
  publisher = {Tulika Books},
  abstract = {There is no area in the agrarian history of eastern India that Binay Bhushan Chaudhuri has not traversed. His journey began with his 1956 contribution in Bengal Past and Present, on "Some Problems of the Peasantry of Bengal after the Permanent Settlement." His extensive opus surveys the agrarian economy of eastern India and all its protagonists: peasant households, zamindars and the state, non-peasant rural agents such as moneylenders, affluent landholders, farmers, and agrarian intermediaries (jotedars), all of whom played their decisive role in the rural agrarian structure of eastern India. His later research explored the impact of colonial rule on tribes and forest dwellers, who were in the process of transition to quasi-peasant communities by the middle of the twentieth century. In his pioneering work, The Growth of Commercial Agriculture in Bengal: 1757–1957, which developed out of his doctoral thesis, Chaudhuri discussed the two important phenomena that shaped the contours of the agrarian economy of Bengal—first, the demographic factor, namely population growth, combined with a simultaneous growth of agricultural production; second, the role of external demand that determined peasant production for the market. He placed value, additionally, on factors such as climate change, natural disasters, and political instability arising out of war and invasions, which affected agricultural production in India.It is difficult to do justice to B. B. Chaudhuri's academic work given its depth and range. An inadequate attempt is made here under four broad heads: (i) his concept of the peasantry; (ii) the growth of commercial agriculture in eastern India; (iii) the process of 'depeasantization' by which small and marginal peasants gradually lost their land and turned into sharecroppers or hired labor; and finally, (iv) the more or less forcible induction of a large number of tribes and forest dwellers into settled agriculture, resulting in spates of rebellion. The essays in this volume are on diverse themes. A number are on different aspects of the agrarian world, the major subject of Binay Bhushan Chaudhuri's academic research. Many other papers discuss aspects of social and cultural history, which have always interested and inspired Prof. Chaudhuri. There are three essays on Rabindranath Tagore, the towering figure he venerates like most intellectuals of his generation from Bengal, and with whom he also happens to share his own birthday.},

  abstract = {Structural realism has recently re‐entered mainstream discussions in the philosophy of science. The central notion of structure, however, is contested by both advocates and critics. This paper briefly reviews currently prominent structuralist accounts en route to proposing a metaphysics of structure that is capable of supporting the epistemic aspirations of realists, and that is immune to the charge most commonly levelled against structuralism. This account provides an alternative to the existing epistemic and ontic forms of the position, incorporating elements of both. Structures are here identified with relations between first order, causal properties: properties that confer specific dispositions for relations. This form of structuralism constitutes an explicit proposal for what seem implicit structuralist tendencies in sophisticated but more traditional characterizations of realism. An outline of the proposal's response to the anti‐realist's pessimistic induction on the history of scientific theories is considered.}

According to the author, the Matrix Hypothesis is equivalent to a version of the following three-part Metaphysical Hypothesis. First, physical processes are fundamentally computational. Second, our cognitive systems are separate from physical processes, but interact with these processes. Third, physical reality was created by beings outside physical space-time. The Metaphysical Hypothesis combines the Creation Hypothesis, the Computational Hypothesis, and the Mind-Body Hypothesis. It also adds a more specific claim: the computational processes underlying physical space-time were designed by the creators as a computer simulation of a world.},

  abstract = {We investigate several conceptions of linguistic structure to determine whether or not they can provide simple and "revealing" grammars that generate all of the sentences of English and only these. We find that no finite-state Markov process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that producen-order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasingn, to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of "phrase structure" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an investigation on the mechanical properties of two bamboo species, namely Bambusa Pervariabilis (or Kao Jue) and Phyllostachys Pubescens (or Mao Jue), which are commonly used in access scaffoldings in the South East Asia, in particular, in Hong Kong and the Southern China. A pilot study was carried out to examine the variation of compressive strength against various physical properties along the length of bamboo culms for both bamboo species. Moreover, systematic test series with a large number of compression and bending tests were executed to establish characteristic values of both the strengths and the Young's moduli of each bamboo species for limit state structural design. It is shown that both Kao Jue and Mao Jue are good constructional materials with excellent mechanical properties against compression and bending. With a suitable choice of partial safety factors, structural engineers are able to design bamboo structures at a known level of confidence against failure. Structural engineers are thus encouraged to take the advantage offered by bamboo to build light and strong structures to achieve enhanced economy and buildability. The effective use of structural bamboo as a substitute to structural timber will mitigate the pressures on the ever-shrinking natural forests in developing countries, and thus, facilitate the conservation of the global environment.},

  abstract = {Learning theory has frequently been applied to language acquisition, but discussion has largely focused on information theoretic problems—in particular on the absence of direct negative evidence. Such arguments typically neglect the probabilistic nature of cognition and learning in general. We argue first that these arguments, and analyses based on them, suffer from a major flaw: they systematically conflate the hypothesis class and the learnable concept class. As a result, they do not allow one to draw significant conclusions about the learner. Second, we claim that the real problem for language learning is the computational complexity of constructing a hypothesis from input data. Studying this problem allows for a more direct approach to the object of study—the language acquisition device—rather than the learnable class of languages, which is epiphenomenal and possibly hard to characterize. The learnability results informed by complexity studies are much more insightful. They strongly suggest that target grammars need to be objective, in the sense that the primitive elements of these grammars are based on objectively definable properties of the language itself. These considerations support the view that language acquisition proceeds primarily through data-driven learning of some form.},

In pre-colonial times, clothing, jewellery and insignia conveyed identity, status, values and a sense of occasion. Those with access to European trade cloth and second-hand clothes integrated them into their dress. Central Africans had a strong sense of the “politics of costume” long before new sources and ideas of clothing arrived with colonialism.Brazzaville, the capital of French Equatorial Africa, then became the scene of opportunity, experimentation and choice. Foreign workers from West Africa, the French Antilles and the Central African coastal regions pioneered new styles which were quickly appropriated and adapted by other townspeople. Europeans, in their attire, also seemed to confirm the importance of dress and were a model for those who considered themselves évolués. In handing out clothing, European employers and missionaries had their own agenda, which was rejected by many townspeople as an autonomous fashion sense developed in Bacongo and Poto-Poto, the African districts of Brazzaville. With an entrenched monetary economy, cloth and clothing became widely available to all with cash. Styles, costs and values became issues of contention. Clothing not only symbolized change but became a vehicle for change.In the late colonial period, the sources allow a deeper understanding of the relationship of dress to controversial social issues. Clothing became an arena for contesting and asserting class, gender and generational roles.},

From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second.

  abstract = {Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhea and is associated with an increased risk of mortality. The use of probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been studied to reduce the incidence and severity of this infection, but variable efficacy and safety data have been reported. Probiotics are hypothesized to be effective in the management of CDI through a number of mechanisms that include maintenance of normal gastrointestinal flora, antimicrobial and antitoxin properties, and immunomodulatory effects. Despite promising results in small trials and meta-analyses, prospective, randomized, controlled trials have not demonstrated probiotics to be effective in the primary prevention of C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). Probiotics may be effective for secondary prevention in patients with recurrent CDI, but guidelines acknowledge the lack of compelling evidence. Trials are limited by the use of varying types of strains, numbers of strains, and doses of probiotics, as well the definitions of CDI and CDAD. FMT has been proposed as a method for restoring gut microbiota and has been shown to significantly increase the rate of cure in patients with recurrent CDI. Current studies have demonstrated minimal adverse effects, with no reports of transmission of infectious diseases; however, the optimal delivery method, sample preparation, and donor selection remain unclear. In this review, findings from recent literature are highlighted, and guideline recommendations for the use of these agents in the primary and secondary prevention of CDI are summarized.},

This approach offers a more fruitful way to understand the Cultural Revolution and its historical legacies.The book provides a new look at the student Red Guard movements, the effort to identify and cultivate potential “revolutionary” leaders in outlying provinces, stubborn resistance to campaigns to destroy the old culture, and the violence and mass killings in rural China.},

This paper investigates change in patterns of mortality at local authority level in England (2010–11 to 2017–18) and the relation with fiscal austerity measures.Data from official local authority administrative records are used to quantify the gap between observed deaths and what was anticipated in the 2010-based subnational population projections. Regression analyses are used to explore the relation between excess deaths, austerity and wider process of population change at local authority level.We estimate 231~707 total excess deaths, the majority of which occurred since 2014–15 (89\%) across the majority of local authorities (91\%). Austerity is positively associated with excess deaths. For working age adults, there is a clear gradient to the impact of austerity, whereas for older adults, the impact is more uniform.Fiscal austerity policies contributed to an excess of deaths for older people and widened social inequalities for younger populations. These results call for an end to all austerity measures and require further research into areas with the highest total excess deaths as a priority following the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Cultures notoriously differ as to the content of their rules, but there is no culture without rules. In this book, historian of science Lorraine Daston adopts a long term perspective for studying rules from diverse sources, including monastic orders, cookbooks, and mathematical algorithms. She argues that in the Western tradition most rules can be characterized as one of the following: tools of measurement and calculation, models or paradigms, or laws. Moreover, they exist on spectra from specific to general, flexible to rigid and the specific-to-general, and universal-to-particular. In investigating how rules work, how they don't work, how they've changed across time, and why exceptions are necessary, Daston paints a vivid picture of Western civilization from the antiquity to the present"--},

The authors then identify neuropsychological anomalies that could produce the unusual experiences that may lead, in turn, to the delusions in their battery. However, the authors argue against B. A. Maher's view that delusions are false beliefs that arise as normal responses to anomalous experiences. It is proposed, instead, that a second factor is required to account for the transition from unusual experience to delusional belief. The second factor in the etiology of delusions can be described superficially as a loss of the ability to reject a candidate for belief on the grounds of its implausibility and its inconsistency with everything else that the patient knows, but the authors point out some problems that confront any attempt to say more about the nature of this second factor.

  abstract = {Computational complexity theory is a subfield of theoretical computer science one of whose primary goals is to classify and compare the practical difficulty of solving problems about finite combinatorial objects – e.g. given two natural numbers nn and mm, are they relatively prime? Given a propositional formula ϕ\textbackslash phi, does it have a satisfying assignment? If we were to play chess on a board of size n×nn \textbackslash times n, does white have a winning strategy from a given initial position? These problems are equally difficult from the standpoint of classical  computability theory in the sense that they are all effectively decidable. Yet they still appear to differ significantly in practical difficulty. For having been supplied with a pair of numbers m{$>$}n{$>$}0m \textbackslash gt n \textbackslash gt 0, it is possible to determine their relative primality by a method (Euclid’s algorithm) which requires a number of steps proportional to log(n)\textbackslash log(n). On the other hand, all known methods for solving the latter two problems require a ‘brute force’ search through a large class of cases which increase at least exponentially in the size of the problem instance.},

Intuitively, we study the complexity of deciding queries such as the following: Is Alice’s epistemic information strictly coarser than Bob’s? Do Alice and Bob have the same knowledge about each other’s knowledge? Is it possible to manipulate Alice in a way that she will have the same beliefs as Bob? The results show that these problems lie on both sides of the border between tractability (P) and intractability (NP-hard). In particular, we investigate the impact of assuming information structures to be partition-based (rather than arbitrary relational structures) on the complexity of various problems. We focus on the tractability of concrete epistemic tasks and not on epistemic logics describing them.},

Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the most widely known types of IBD and have been the focus of attention due to their increasing incidence. Recent studies have pointed out genes associated with IBD susceptibility that, together with environment factors, may contribute to the outcome of the disease. In ulcerative colitis, there are several therapies available, depending on the stage of the disease. Aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and cyclosporine are used to treat mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. In Crohn’s disease, drug choices are dependent on both location and behavior of the disease. Nowadays, advances in treatments for IBD have included biological therapies, based mainly on monoclonal antibodies or fusion proteins, such as anti-TNF drugs. Notwithstanding the high cost involved, these biological therapies show a high index of remission, enabling a significant reduction in cases of surgery and hospitalization. Furthermore, migration inhibitors and new cytokine blockers are also a promising alternative for treating patients with IBD. In this review, an analysis of literature data on biological treatments for IBD is approached, with the main focus on therapies based on emerging recombinant biomolecules.},

The policy outcomes during his reign turned out to be fundamentally different in the two countries: Whereas in Belgium he improved living conditions, in the Congo he established a brutal tyranny. This paper analyses the reasons for these different leadership styles of Leopold II by means of the 'selectorate theory'. The selectorate theory explains policy outcomes as a function of governance institutions. It assumes that the ruler maximizes his own utility which means first of all to sustain himself in power. Under Belgium's governmental institutions Leopold II required broad support from the general public but in the Congo he only needed a very small group of supporters. To reduce the possibility that Leopold's different leadership styles were caused mainly by racism his period is compared to the reign of the Congolese leader Mobutu Sese Seko.},

Although its meaning may strike the present-day reader as unusual, such a reconstruction is possible from the background of eighteenth-century practices and concepts of natural inquiry. As I argue, Hume's inquiries into human nature are experimental not primarily because of the way the empirical data he uses are produced, but because of the way those data are theoretically processed. He seems to follow a method of analysis and synthesis quite similar to the one advertised in Newton's Opticks, which profoundly influenced eighteenth-century natural and moral philosophy. This method brings him much closer to the methods of qualitative, chemical investigations than to mechanical approaches to both nature and human nature.},

I will proceed by first explicating the position I call contextualism, and distinguishing that position from some closely related positions in epistemology, some of which sometimes also go by the name of “contextualism.” I'll then present and answer what seems to many the most pressing of the objections to contextualism as I construe it, and also indicate some of the main positive motivations for accepting the view. Among the epistemologists I've spoken with who have an opinion on the matter, I think it's fair to say a majority reject contextualism. However, the resistance has to this point been largely underground, with little by way of sustained arguments against contextualism appearing in the journals,1 though I have begun to see various papers in manuscript form which are critical of contextualism. Here, I'll respond to the criticism of contextualism that, in my travels, I have found to be the most pervasive in producing suspicion about the view.},

He refuses to abandon his daily activities and philosophical pursuits, and he offers no clear account of what entitles him to sustain them. This paper explores a variety of tactics for addressing these opposing elements of his thought. The most radical approach has Hume endorse nothing whatsoever in the Treatise, a maneuver that prevents any conflict between his doubts and his commitments from arising, though at a tremendous cost. A more charitable strategy allows Hume to speak with one consistent voice throughout the text by rejecting, repurposing, or restricting either his doubts or his commitments in a way that resolves the tension between them. Yet a third approach takes Hume to advance incompatible and irreconcilable positions but holds that the inconsistency in his thinking is not as destructive as it initially appears. None of the most promising ways of developing these proposals eliminates or satisfactorily eases the conflict in Hume’s work, and the enormous obstacles that they face give us little reason to hope for something better.},

Apart from possible surprises, there appeared to be three alternatives, which it was especially desired to discriminate between— (1) The path is uninfluenced by gravitation. (2) The energy or mass of light is subject to gravitation in the same way as ordinary matter. If the law of gravitation is strictly the Newtonian law, this leads to an apparent displacement of a star close to the sun’s limb amounting to 0"·87 outwards. (3) The course of a, ray of light is in accordance with Einstein’s generalised relativity theory. This leads to an apparent displacement of a star at the limb amounting to 1"·75 outwards. In either of the last two cases the displacement is inversely proportional to the distance of the star from the sun’s centre, the displacement under (3) being just double the displacement under (2).},

Laughter is found to be non-phonemic and multiple-track (like music) rather than lineal (like phonemes).}

  abstract = {Imperial Rome was by far the largest city of its time, and feeding its populace—about one million according to most estimates—required an ever-watchful eye on the part of the authorities. The system supplying Rome, the armies, and some other cities with grain and other foodstuffs came to be known as the annona. The Roman authorities began to intervene directly in the food supply of the city of Rome in the mid-Republican period. A momentous step in this development was the introduction of the grain distribution (frumentatio) by C. Sempronius Gracchus in 123 bce. In the Principate, the annona became a central feature of the relationship between the emperor and the capital’s inhabitants. At the end of Augustus’s reign the office of the annona came to be headed by a praefectus annonae, who had recourse to a staff of subordinates in Rome, Ostia, and Puteoli. Apart from the produce of the imperial estates, Rome collected tax grain primarily in Sicily, Sardinia, and Africa, and from Augustus onwards in Egypt; Rome was then largely sustained by this flow of public grain. The main responsibility of the praefectus annonae was to administer the transportation by means of shipping contracts from the grain provinces to Rome and to curb fraud and speculation on the grain market. The prefect also offered legal support for private businessmen involved in the annona. Part of the public stock was distributed at the frumentationes, which fed a significant part, but not all, of the populace. When Constantinople was founded as a new capital by Constantine, Rome lost access to the Egyptian tax-grain and relied heavily on Africa for grain and olive oil. The system of the annona was enforced more strictly, and shippers involved in the food supply of Rome found themselves bound to their obligations to the annona. In the West, the system ended when Africa was conquered by the Vandals in 429 ce. In the East, Constantinople continued to rely on Egypt until it was conquered by the Persians in 617 ce.},

  abstract = {The naive theory of properties states that for every condition there is a property instantiated by exactly the things which satisfy that condition. The naive theory of properties is inconsistent in classical logic, but there are many ways to obtain consistent naive theories of properties in nonclassical logics. The naive theory of classes adds to the naive theory of properties an extensionality rule or axiom, which states roughly that if two classes have exactly the same members, they are identical. In this paper we examine the prospects for obtaining a satisfactory naive theory of classes. We start from a result by Ross Brady, which demonstrates the consistency of something resembling a naive theory of classes. We generalize Brady’s result somewhat and extend it to a recent system developed by Andrew Bacon. All of the theories we prove consistent contain an extensionality rule or axiom. But we argue that given the background logics, the relevant extensionality principles are too weak. For example, in some of these theories, there are universal classes which are not declared coextensive. We elucidate some very modest demands on extensionality, designed to rule out this kind of pathology. But we close by proving that even these modest demands cannot be jointly satisfied. In light of this new impossibility result, the prospects for a naive theory of classes are bleak.},

I demonstrate this using Carnap’s metametaphysical position in his 'Empiricism, Semantics and Ontology' (1950) as an example, with regard to how it exhibits self-reference and results in inconsistency. I show how applying Carnap’s position to itself produces a dilemma, both horns of which lead to a contradiction. Such inconsistency commonly arises from meta-theories with global scope, as the 'meta' approach aims to transcend the scope of that which it is theorizing about, whilst the global nature will place itself back within the scope of that which it is theorizing about, which together result in the theory referring to itself whilst refuting itself. I argue that any global metametaphysical theory that draws a limit to thought will face self-reference problems leading to contradictory realms. My conclusion is conditional: If we want to meta-philosophize in such a way and treat quietist meta-theories as being true, then we need to be dialetheist and utilize a paraconsistent logic in order to accommodate the contradictions that result from such theorizing.},

  abstract = {What determines what we see? In contrast to the traditional “modular” understanding of perception, according to which visual processing is encapsulated from higher-level cognition, a tidal wave of recent research alleges that states such as beliefs, desires, emotions, motivations, intentions, and linguistic representations exert direct, top-down influences on what we see. There is a growing consensus that such effects are ubiquitous, and that the distinction between perception and cognition may itself be unsustainable. We argue otherwise: None of these hundreds of studies~–~either individually or collectively~–~provides compelling evidence for true top-down effects on perception, or “cognitive penetrability.” In particular, and despite their variety, we suggest that these studies all fall prey to only a handful of pitfalls. And whereas abstract theoretical challenges have failed to resolve this debate in the past, our presentation of these pitfalls is empirically anchored: In each case, we show not only how certain studies could be susceptible to the pitfall (in principle), but also how several alleged top-down effects actually are explained by the pitfall (in practice). Moreover, these pitfalls are perfectly general, with each applying to dozens of other top-down effects. We conclude by extracting the lessons provided by these pitfalls into a checklist that future work could use to convincingly demonstrate top-down effects on visual perception. The discovery of substantive top-down effects of cognition on perception would revolutionize our understanding of how the mind is organized; but without addressing these pitfalls, no such empirical report will license such exciting conclusions.},

  abstract = {Human associated microbial communities exert tremendous influence over human health and disease. With modern metagenomic sequencing methods it is now possible to follow the relative abundance of microbes in a community over time. These microbial communities exhibit rich ecological dynamics and an important goal of microbial ecology is to infer the ecological interactions between species directly from sequence data. Any algorithm for inferring ecological interactions must overcome three major obstacles: 1) a correlation between the abundances of two species does not imply that those species are interacting, 2) the sum constraint on the relative abundances obtained from metagenomic studies makes it difficult to infer the parameters in timeseries models, and 3) errors due to experimental uncertainty, or mis-assignment of sequencing reads into operational taxonomic units, bias inferences of species interactions due to a statistical problem called “errors-in-variables”. Here we introduce an approach, Learning Interactions from MIcrobial Time Series (LIMITS), that overcomes these obstacles. LIMITS uses sparse linear regression with boostrap aggregation to infer a discrete-time Lotka-Volterra model for microbial dynamics. We tested LIMITS on synthetic data and showed that it could reliably infer the topology of the inter-species ecological interactions. We then used LIMITS to characterize the species interactions in the gut microbiomes of two individuals and found that the interaction networks varied significantly between individuals. Furthermore, we found that the interaction networks of the two individuals are dominated by distinct “keystone species”, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroided stercosis, that have a disproportionate influence on the structure of the gut microbiome even though they are only found in moderate abundance. Based on our results, we hypothesize that the abundances of certain keystone species may be responsible for individuality in the human gut microbiome.},

The objectives of this manuscript are to summarize the status of the clinical TB vaccine pipeline; to assess the challenges facing the TB development field; and to discuss some of the key strategies being embraced by the field to overcome these challenges. Currently, 8 of the 13 vaccines in clinical development are subunit vaccines; 6 of these contain or express either Ag85A or Ag85B proteins. A major challenge to TB vaccine development is the lack of diversity in both the antigens included in TB vaccines, and the immune responses elicited by TB vaccine candidates. Both will need to be expanded to maximise the potential for developing a successful candidate by 2025. Current research efforts are focused on broadening both antigen selection and the range of vaccine-mediated immune responses. Previous and ongoing TB vaccine efficacy trials have built capacity, generated high quality data on TB incidence and prevalence, and provided insight into immune correlates of risk of TB disease. These gains will enable the design of better TB vaccines and, importantly, move these vaccines into efficacy trials more rapidly and at a lower cost than was possible for previous TB vaccine candidates.},

  abstract = {This paper explores differences between Connectionist proposals for cognitive architecture and the sorts of models that have traditionally been assumed in cognitive science. We claim that the major distinction is that, while both Connectionist and Classical architectures postulate representational mental states, the latter but not the former are committed to a symbol-level of representation, or to a ‘language of thought’: i.e., to representational states that have combinatorial syntactic and semantic structure. Several arguments for combinatorial structure in mental representations are then reviewed. These include arguments based on the ‘systematicity’ of mental representation: i.e., on the fact that cognitive capacities always exhibit certain symmetries, so that the ability to entertain a given thought implies the ability to entertain thoughts with semantically related contents. We claim that such arguments make a powerful case that mind/brain architecture is not Connectionist at the cognitive level. We then consider the possibility that Connectionism may provide an account of the neural (or ‘abstract neurological’) structures in which Classical cognitive architecture is implemented. We survey a number of the standard arguments that have been offered in favor of Connectionism, and conclude that they are coherent only on this interpretation. Résumé Cet articleétudie les différences entre modèles connectionistes et modèles classiques de la structure cognitive. Nous pensons que, bien que les deux types de modèles stipulent l'existence d'états mentaux représentationnels, la différence essentielle est que seuls les modèles classiques requièrent l'existence d'un niveau de représentation symbolique—un “langage de la pensée”—, c'est-à-dire d'états représentationnels possédant une structure syntaxique et sémantique. Nous examinons ensuite différents arguments qui militent en faveur de l'existence de représentations mentales ayant ces propriétés. Certains de ces arguments reposent sur la “systématicité” des représentations mentales, c'est-à-dire sur le fait que les capacités cognitives exhibent toujours certaines symétries, de sorte que la capacitéd'entretenir certaines pensées implique la capacitéd'entretenir d'autres pensées apparentées par leur contenu sémantique. Nous pensons que ces arguments montrent de manière convainquante que l'architecture de l'esprit/du cerveau n'est pas connectioniste au niveau cognitif. Nous nous demandons ensuite s'il est possible d'interpréter le connectionisme comme une analyse des structures neuronales (ou des structures neurologiques “abstraites”) dans lesquelles est réalisée l'architecture cognitive classique. Nous examinons plusieurs des arguments avancés habituellement en défense du connectionisme, et en concluons que ceux-ci n'ont de sens que dans cette interprétation.},

Smolensky thinks connectionists can explain systematicity if they avail themselves of “distributed” mental representations. In fact, Smolensky offers two accounts of distributed mental representation, corresponding to his notions of “weak” and “strong” compositional structure. We argue that weak compositional structure is irrelevant to the systematicity problem and of dubious internal coherence. We then argue that strong compositional (tensor product) representations fail to explain systematicity because they fail to exhibit the sort of constituents that can provide domains for structure sensitive mental processes.},

  abstract = {The rationality assumptions that are made when one interprets texts or explains actions have been regarded as necessary (Davidson, Dray), empirical (Hempel), superfluous (Popper), or false (Donagan). After a survey of different notions of rationality and the role that each of them plays in interpretation and in the explanation of action, the author's view is presented in four theses: (1) some degree of rationality is necessary, (2) reasons for actions should always be included in their explanation, even where purely causal factors would suffice to explain them, (3) explanations should not seek to maximize rationality, and (4) man is striving to be rational. Résumé Les présupposés de rationalité faits lorsqu'on interprète des textes ou explique des actions ont été considérés comme nécessaires (Davidson, Dray), empiriques (Hempel), superflus (Popper) ou faux (Donagan). Aprés un inventaire des différentes notions de rationalité et du rôle que chacune d'elles joue dans l'interprétation et l'explication de Taction, la position de l'auteur est présentée en quatre théses: (1) un certain degré de rationalite est nécessairé, (2) les raisons des actions devraient toujours ětre incluses dans l'explication de cellesci, même si des facteurs purement causals devaient suffire pour les expliquer, (3) les explications ne devraient pas tendre à maximiser la rationalité, et (4) l'homme tend àêtre rationnel. Zusammenfassung Die Rationalitätsvoraussetzungen, die man beim Interpretieren von Texten oder bei der Erklarung von Handlungen macht, sind als notwendig (Davidson, Dray), empirisch (Hempel), überflüssig (Popper) oder falsch (Donagan) betrachtet worden. Nach einem Überblick über verschiedene Begriffe von Rationalität und der Rolle, die diese bei der Interpretation und Erklärung von Handlung spielen, legt der Verfasser vier Thesen vor: (1) Ein gewisser Grad von Rationalität ist notwendig, (2) Griinde für Handlungen sollten bei ihrer Erklärung immer berücksichtigt werden, sogar wenn rein kausale Faktoren für die Erklärung genügen wiirden, (3) Erklärungen sollten nicht darauf ausgerichtet sein, Rationalität zu maximie-ren und (4) der Mensch strebt danach, rational zu sein.},

The article proposes a definition of negative determiners, leading naturally to a bilateral PTS for them.

Microbiome composition can be rapidly altered by exposure to antibiotics, with potential immediate effects on health, for instance through the selection of resistant opportunistic pathogens that can cause acute disease. Microbiome alterations induced by antibiotics can also indirectly affect health in the long-term. The mutualistic microbes in the human body interact with many physiological processes, and participate in the regulation of immune and metabolic homeostasis. Therefore, antibiotic exposure can alter many basic physiological equilibria, promoting long-term disease. In addition, excessive antibiotic use fosters bacterial resistance, and the overly exposed human microbiome has become a significant reservoir of resistance genes, contributing to the increasing difficulty in controlling bacterial infections. Here, the complex relationships between antibiotics and the human microbiome are reviewed, with focus on the intestinal microbiota, addressing 1) the effects of antibiotic use on the composition and function of the gut microbiota, 2) the impact of antibiotic-induced microbiota alterations on immunity, metabolism, and health, and 3) the role of the gut microbiota as a reservoir of antibiotic resistances.},

Blood samples were taken at scheduled times during administration of the drug. At operation, synovial fluid and tissue samples were taken and their salicylate, paracetamol and benorylate content measured. Plasma levels of salicylate and paracetamol were, in general, significantly higher than the concentration of these metabolites in the synovial fluid. Benorylate was found in the synovial tissues concentrated especially in the highly inflamed synovial villi. It is probable that benorylate and its metabolites penetrate the synovia but further studies are needed to determine if the metabolites are concentrated in the different synovial cell layers in the same way as benorylate itself. It is possible that part of the clinical effect of benorylate is due to its presence in the synovial tissue and that it has a direct effect in vivo on the synovial membrane. It is also possible that the pharmacokinetic properties of benorylate permit it to enter cell layers inaccessible to its metabolites.},

Friedman is best known for his work in monetary theory and for his concern for free enterprise and individual liberty. Milton Friedman was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics in 1976. The following essay, which is reprinted in its entirety, is the most influential work on economic methodology of this century.In his admirable book on The Scope and Method of Political Economy John Neville Keynes distinguishes among “a positive science … [,] a body of systematized knowledge concerning what is; a normative or regulative science … [,] a body of systematized knowledge discussing criteria of what ought to be …; an art … [,] a system of rules for the attainment of a given end”; comments that “confusion between them is common and has been the source of many mischievous errors”; and urges the importance of “recognizing a distinct positive science of political economy.”This [essay] is concerned primarily with certain methodological problems that arise in constructing the “distinct positive science” Keynes called for – in particular, the problem how to decide whether a suggested hypothesis or theory should be tentatively accepted as part of the “body of systematized knowledge concerning what is.”},

Whilst blood and urine from the victim are routinely analysed, due to the delay in reporting DFSA cases and the short half lives of most of these drugs in blood and urine, drug detection in such samples is problematic. Consideration of the drinks involved and analysis for drugs may start to address this. Here we have reconstructed the ‘spiking’ of three benzodiazepines (diazepam, flunitrazepam and temazepam) into five drinks, an alcopop (flavoured alcoholic drink), a beer, a white wine, a spirit, and a fruit based non-alcoholic drink (J2O) chosen as representative of those drinks commonly used by women in 16–24 year old age group. Using a validated GC-MS method for the simultaneous detection of these drugs in the drinks we have studied the storage stability of the benzodiazepines under two different storage conditions, uncontrolled room temperature and refrigerator (4°C) over a 25 day period. All drugs could be detected in all beverages over this time period. Diazepam was found to be stable in all of the beverages, except the J2O, under both storage conditions. Flunitrazepam and temazepam were found not to be stable but were detectable (97\% loss of temazepam and 39\% loss of flunitrazepam from J2O). The recommendations from this study are that there should be a policy change and that drinks thought to be involved in DFSA cases should be collected and analysed wherever possible to support other evidence types.},

The emergence of S. aureus strains that are highly resistant to antimicrobials has recently become a major public health concern. In low-income countries the incidence of S. aureus disease is highest in neonates and children up to one year of age and mortality rates are estimated to be up to 50\%. In the United States, S. aureus infection accounts for approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year. A vaccine against multi-drug resistant S. aureus, therefore, is urgently needed. Two vaccine candidates have previously been evaluated in late-stage clinical trials but have not demonstrated efficacy. At present, one vaccine candidate and two monoclonal antibody are undergoing clinical evaluation in target groups at high risk for S. aureus infection. This review provides an overview of current vaccine development efforts and presents the major technical and regulatory challenges to developing a licensed S. aureus vaccine.},

  abstract = {Axiomatic rationality is defined in terms of conformity to abstract axioms. Savage (The foundations of statistics, Wiley, New York, 1954) limited axiomatic rationality to small worlds (S, C), that is, situations in which the exhaustive and mutually exclusive set of future states S and their consequences C are known. Others have interpreted axiomatic rationality as a categorical norm for how human beings should reason, arguing in addition that violations would lead to real costs such as money pumps. Yet a review of the literature shows little evidence that violations are actually associated with any measurable costs. Limiting axiomatic rationality to small worlds, I propose a naturalized version of rationality for situations of intractability and uncertainty (as opposed to risk), all of which are not in (S, C). In these situations, humans can achieve their goals by relying on heuristics that may violate axiomatic rationality. The study of ecological rationality requires formal models of heuristics and an analysis of the structures of environments these can exploit. It lays the foundation of a moderate naturalism in epistemology, providing statements about heuristics we should use in a given situation. Unlike axiomatic rationality, ecological rationality can explain less-ismore effects (when using less information can be expected to generate more accurate predictions), formalize when one should move from ‘is’ to ‘ought,’ and be evaluated by goals beyond coherence, such as predictive accuracy, frugality, and efficiency. Ecological rationality can be seen as a formalization of means–end instrumentalist rationality, based on Herbert Simon’s insight that rational behavior is a function of the mind and its environment.},

  abstract = {Language learnability has been investigated. This refers to the following situation: A class of possible languages is specified, together with a method of presenting information to the learner about an unknown language, which is to be chosen from the class. The question is now asked, “Is the information sufficient to determine which of the possible languages is the unknown language?” Many definitions of learnability are possible, but only the following is considered here: Time is quantized and has a finite starting time. At each time the learner receives a unit of information and is to make a guess as to the identity of the unknown language on the basis of the information received so far. This process continues forever. The class of languages will be considered learnable with respect to the specified method of information presentation if there is an algorithm that the learner can use to make his guesses, the algorithm having the following property: Given any language of the class, there is some finite time after which the guesses will all be the same and they will be correct. In this preliminary investigation, a language is taken to be a set of strings on some finite alphabet. The alphabet is the same for all languages of the class. Several variations of each of the following two basic methods of information presentation are investigated: A text for a language generates the strings of the language in any order such that every string of the language occurs at least once. An informant for a language tells whether a string is in the language, and chooses the strings in some order such that every string occurs at least once. It was found that the class of context-sensitive languages is learnable from an informant, but that not even the class of regular languages is learnable from a text.}

In the first half of the article, I describe a variety of structured plural expressions and predicates they can combine with and I point out the difficulties faced by two extant approaches to the semantics of plurals: inflationary and cover-based semantics. In the second half of the article, I propose an alternative account which combines elements from both of them. The main novelty of my proposal is that, by capitalising on the background operation of certain pragmatic principles, it correctly formalises the fact that some interpretations of ambiguous sentences involving structured plurality are more accessible than others.},

Of these, pure structuralism is most plausibly taken to enjoy significant advantages over platonism.

The proposal has two parts: (1) an abstraction principle (’ratio abstraction’) is given, which represents the real numbers as ratios of quantities. However, this procedure is effective only if we are already given a domain of objects with a particular kind of structure. (2) A series of abstractions (starting with HP, and including a Dedekind‐inspired ’cut abstraction’) gives a domain with the required kind of structure to underpin (1).},

For 3-SAT, a tiny improvement over PPSZ was obtained by Hertli. We introduce a biased version of the PPSZ algorithm using which we obtain an improvement over PPSZ for every k≥ 3. For k=3 we also improve on Herli’s result and get a much more noticeable improvement over PPSZ, though still relatively small. In particular, for Unique 3-SAT, we improve the current bound from 1.308n to 1.307n.},

  abstract = {We generally think that the observations we make are able to justifysome expectations or predictions about observations we have not yetmade, as well as general claims that go beyond the observed. Forexample, the observation that bread of a certain appearance has thusfar been nourishing seems to justify the expectation that the nextsimilar piece of bread I eat will also be nourishing, as well as theclaim that bread of this sort is generally nourishing. Such inferencesfrom the observed to the unobserved, or to general laws, are known as“inductive inferences”., The original source of what has become known as the “problem ofinduction” is in Book 1, part iii, section 6 of A Treatiseof Human Nature by David Hume, published in 1739 (Hume 1739). In1748, Hume gave a shorter version of the argument in Section iv ofAn enquiry concerning human understanding (Hume 1748).Throughout this article we will give references to theTreatise as “T”, and the Enquiry as“E”., Hume asks on what grounds we come to our beliefs about the unobservedon the basis of inductive inferences. He presents an argument in theform of a dilemma which appears to rule out the possibility of anyreasoning from the premises to the conclusion of an inductiveinference. There are, he says, two possible types of arguments,“demonstrative” and “probable”, but neitherwill serve. A demonstrative argument produces the wrong kind ofconclusion, and a probable argument would be circular. Therefore, forHume, the problem remains of how to explain why we form anyconclusions that go beyond the past instances of which we have hadexperience (T. 1.3.6.10). Hume stresses that he is not disputing thatwe do draw such inferences. The challenge, as he sees it, is tounderstand the “foundation” of the inference—the“logic” or “process of argument” that it isbased upon (E. 4.2.21). The problem of meeting this challenge, whileevading Hume’s argument against the possibility of doing so, hasbecome known as “the problem of induction”., Hume’s argument is one of the most famous in philosophy. Anumber of philosophers have attempted solutions to the problem, but asignificant number have embraced his conclusion that it is insoluble.There is also a wide spectrum of opinion on the significance of theproblem. Some have argued that Hume’s argument does notestablish any far-reaching skeptical conclusion, either because it wasnever intended to, or because the argument is in some waymisformulated. Yet many have regarded it as one of the most profoundphilosophical challenges imaginable since it seems to call intoquestion the justification of one of the most fundamental ways inwhich we form knowledge. Bertrand Russell, for example, expressed theview that if Hume’s problem cannot be solved, “there is nointellectual difference between sanity and insanity” (Russell1946: 699)., In this article, we will first examine Hume’s own argument,provide a reconstruction of it, and then survey different responses tothe problem which it poses.},

  abstract = {It has long been known that increasing the number of tapes used by a Turing machine does not provide the ability to compute any new functions. On the other hand, the use of extra tapes does make it possible to speed up the computation of certain functions. It is known that a square factor is sometimes required for a one-tape machine to behave as a two-tape machine and that a square factor is always sufficient.The purpose of this paper is to show that, if a given function requires computation time T for a k-tape realization, then it requires at most computation time T log T for a two-tape realization. The proof of this fact is constructive; given any k-tape machine, it is shown how to design an equivalent two-tape machine that operates within the stated time bounds. In addition to being interesting in its own right, the trade-off relation between number of tapes and speed of computation can be used in a diagonalization argument to show that if T(n) and U(n) are two time functions such that inf T(n) log T(n) ÷ U(n) = 0 then there exists a function that can be computed within the time bound U(n) but not within the time bound T(n).},

It maintains that virtually anything is conceivable, and that conceivability is therefore incapable of providing a reliable test for possibility. Whether a conceivable state of affairs is genuinely possible depends on whether it is compatible with the class of necessary truths. But this means that we must have some independent way of recognizing necessity. The article explains that independent access to necessity in terms of the hypothesis that various modal truths constitute an implicit definition of necessity. To a large extent, our knowledge of necessity derives from our grasp of this definition. The article also criticizes Cartesian modal arguments for dualism, and raises an objection to the view that metaphysical necessity can be reductively explained in terms of subjunctive conditionals.},

In the absence of new therapies, mortality rates due to untreatable infections are predicted to rise more than 10-fold by 2050. Natural products (NPs) made by cultured bacteria have been a major source of clinically useful antibiotics. In spite of decades of productivity, the use of bacteria in the search for new antibiotics was largely abandoned due to high rediscovery rates.,  As only a fraction of bacterial diversity is regularly cultivated in the laboratory and just a fraction of the chemistries encoded by cultured bacteria is detected in fermentation experiments, most bacterial NPs remain hidden in the global microbiome. In an effort to access these hidden NPs, we have developed a culture-independent NP discovery platform that involves sequencing, bioinformatic analysis, and heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) captured on DNA extracted from environmental samples (eDNA). Here, we describe the application of this platform to the discovery of the malacidins, a distinctive class of antibiotics that are commonly encoded in soil microbiomes but have never been reported in culture-based NP discovery efforts. The malacidins are active against multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, sterilize MRSA skin infections in an animal wound model, and did not select for resistance under our laboratory conditions.},

Our implementation requires no workspace beyond buffers already incorporated into conventional high-performance DGEMM implementations. Conventional wisdom: a Strassen DGEMM interface must pass in workspace. Our implementation requires no such workspace and can be plug-compatible with the standard DGEMM interface. Conventional wisdom: it is hard to demonstrate speedup on multi-core architectures. Our implementation demonstrates speedup over conventional DGEMM even on an Intel® Xeon Phi™ coprocessor1 utilizing 240 threads.

Because thepredicate ‘heap’ has unclear boundaries, it seems that nosingle grain of wheat can make the difference between a number ofgrains that does, and a number that does not, make a heap. Therefore,since one grain of wheat does not make a heap, it follows that twograins do not; and if two do not, then three do not; and so on. Thisreasoning leads to the absurd conclusion that no number of grains ofwheat make a heap. , The same form of reasoning is familiar in everyday life. DorothyEdgington observes:, The puzzle can be expressed as an argument most simply using modusponens: , The argument is a paradox because apparently impeccable reasoning fromapparently impeccable premises yields a falsehood. The argument can berun equally in the opposite direction, from the premise that onemillion grains make a heap: if one million grains make a heap, thenone million less one grain make a heap; and if one million less onegrain make a heap, then one million less two grains make a heap; etc.It follows, absurdly, that even a single grain makes a heap. Thussoritical reasoning appears to show both that no number of grains makea heap and that any number of grains make a heap., What conclusion should we draw from this untoward result? Is theresomething wrong with the paradoxical argument, or does the use ofvague predicates really lead to absurdity?[1] In part because we use these ordinary words successfully all thetime, and do not normally land in absurdities like the ones above,most theorists of vagueness suppose that the paradox is solvable,i.e., that the paradoxical argument is defective and we can discoverthe defect. In what follows we consider some of the principal attemptsto solve it.},

  abstract = {The k-SAT problem is to determine if a given k-CNF has a satisfying assignment. It is a celebrated open question as to whether it requires exponential time to solve k-SAT for k⩾3. Here exponential time means 2δn for some δ{$>$}0. In this paper, assuming that, for k⩾3, k-SAT requires exponential time complexity, we show that the complexity of k-SAT increases as k increases. More precisely, for k⩾3, define sk=inf\{δ:there exists 2δn algorithm for solving k-SAT\}. Define ETH (Exponential-Time Hypothesis) for k-SAT as follows: for k⩾3, sk{$>$}0. In this paper, we show that sk is increasing infinitely often assuming ETH for k-SAT. Let s∞ be the limit of sk. We will in fact show that sk⩽(1−d/k)s∞ for some constant d{$>$}0. We prove this result by bringing together the ideas of critical clauses and the Sparsification Lemma to reduce the satisfiability of a k-CNF to the satisfiability of a disjunction of 2εnk′-CNFs in fewer variables for some k′⩾k and arbitrarily small ε{$>$}0. We also show that such a disjunction can be computed in time 2εn for arbitrarily small ε{$>$}0.}

The author shows that the fundamental differences (among the many similarities) between the two on the self and causal power do indeed rest on a principled distinction between ‘rationalism’ and ‘empiricism’, and that there is some truth in the traditional story. This, however, is very far from saying that Hume's general orientation is an attack on something called ‘rationalism’.},

  abstract = {A common view in theoretical syntax and computational linguistics holds that there are no grammatical restrictions on multiple center-embedding of clauses. Syntax would thus be characterized by unbounded recursion. An analysis of 119 genuine multiple clausal center-embeddings from seven 'Standard Average European' languages (English, Finnish, French, German, Latin, Swedish, Danish) uncovers usage-based regularities, constraints, that run counter to these and several other widely held views, such as that any type of multiple self-embedding (of the same clause type) would be possible, or that self-embedding would be more complex than multiple center-embedding of different clause types. The maximal degree of center-embedding in written language is three. In spoken language, multiple center- embedding is practically absent. Typical center-embeddings of any degree involve relative clauses specifying the referent of the subject NP of the superordinate clause. Only postmodifying clauses, especially relative clauses and that-clauses acting as noun complements, allow central self-embedding. Double relativization of objects ( The rat the cat the dog chased killed ate the malt) does not occur. These corpus-based ' soft constraints ' suggest that full-blown recursion creating multiple clausal center- embedding is not a central design feature of language in use. Multiple center- embedding emerged with the advent of written language, with Aristotle, Cicero, and Livy in the Greek and Latin stylistic tradition of 'periodic' sentence composition.},

These results are representation independent, in that they hold regardless of the syntactic form in which the learner chooses to represent its hypotheses.Our methods reduce the problems of cracking a number of well-known public-key cryptosystems to the learning problems. We prove that a polynomial-time learning algorithm for Boolean formulae, deterministic finite automata or constant-depth threshold circuits would have dramatic consequences for cryptography and number theory. In particular, such an algorithm could be used to break the RSA cryptosystem, factor Blum integers (composite numbers equivalent to 3 modulo 4), and detect quadratic residues. The results hold even if the learning algorithm is only required to obtain a slight advantage in prediction over random guessing. The techniques used demonstrate an interesting duality between learning and cryptography.We also apply our results to obtain strong intractability results for approximating a generalization of graph coloring.},

But it also seems that a fixed bias toward simplicity cannot indicate or point at the truth, since an indicator has to be sensitive to what it indicates. I argue that both views are correct. It is demonstrated, for a broad range of cases, that the Ockham strategy of favoring the simplest hypothesis, together with the strategy of never dropping the simplest hypothesis until it is no longer simplest, uniquely minimizes reversals of opinion and the times at which the reversals occur prior to convergence to the truth. Thus, simplicity guides one down the straightest path to the truth, even though that path may involve twists and turns along the way. The proof does not appeal to prior probabilities biased toward simplicity. Instead, it is based upon minimization of worst-case cost bounds over complexity classes of possibilities.},

Since for her mathematical singular terms denote places in structures, she would have to say, for example, that 1 = − 1 in the group (Z, +). We call this the identity problem and conclude that nominalism is presently the safest route for the structuralist.},

  abstract = {We present a novel treatment of set theory in a four-valued paraconsistent and paracomplete logic, i.e., a logic in which propositions can be both true and false, and neither true nor false. Our approach is a significant departure from previous research in paraconsistent set theory, which has almost exclusively been motivated by a desire to avoid Russell's paradox and fulfil naive comprehension. Instead, we prioritise setting up a system with a clear ontology of non-classical sets, which can be used to reason informally about incomplete and inconsistent phenomena, and is sufficiently similar to ZFC to enable the development of interesting mathematics. We propose an axiomatic system BZFC, obtained by analysing the ZFC-axioms and translating them to a four-valued setting in a careful manner, avoiding many of the obstacles encountered by other attempted formalizations. We introduce the anti-classicality axiom postulating the existence of non-classical sets, and prove a surprising results stating that the existence of a single non-classical set is sufficient to produce any other type of non-classical set. Our theory is naturally bi-interpretable with ZFC, and provides a philosophically satisfying view in which non-classical sets can be seen as a natural extension of classical ones, in a similar way to the non-well-founded sets of Peter Aczel. Finally, we provide an interesting application concerning Tarski semantics, showing that the classical definition of the satisfaction relation yields a logic precisely reflecting the non-classicality in the meta-theory.},

Functionalism relies essentially on functional explanations of the form "A exists in order to B." I point out problems with previous accounts of such explanations, offer an improved account, and discuss in detail evidence that might confirm such explanations and its difficulties. I argue that some functionalist accounts can be confirmed and that, contra the critics, functionalism's problems are not inherent errors, "only" (avoidable) practical ones.},

  abstract = {From their conception to the present, the social sciences have invoked a kind of explanation that looks suspicious by the standards of the natural sciences. They explain why social practices exist by reference to the purpose or needs they serve. This chapter traces the controversies over the explanations—generally called functional explanations—and argues that they are widespread in some of the best current social science and that they can provide compelling information in some cases, despite the many doubts about them. It surveys the general usage of functional explanations from classic sociologists to the present and common doubts about them. It also surveys past accounts of the working of functional explanations and their problems, and develops two distinct models of functional explanation: selectionist explanations, which show how a practice exists in order to bring about its effects; and functional role analysis, which explain systems in terms of component parts. Further, the chapter discusses specific instances of functional explanation as well as some general mechanisms thought to underlie them. A long-standing dispute in and about the social sciences is the extent to which large scale social phenomena can be explained in individualist terms. Variants of functional explanation might seem to support the individualist side of this dispute by explaining social phenomena entirely in terms of effects that exist in order to promote various individual traits.},

Using a new separator theorem, we show that unit ball graphs in ℍd enjoy similar properties as their Euclidean counterparts, but in one dimension lower: many standard graph problems, such as Independent Set, Dominating Set, Steiner Tree, and Hamiltonian Cycle can be solved in 2O(n1–1/(d–1)) time for any fixed d ≫ 3, while the same problems need 2O(n1–1/d) time in ℝd. We also show that these algorithms in ℍd are optimal up to constant factors in the exponent under ETH. This drop in dimension has the largest impact in ℍ2, where we introduce a new technique to bound the treewidth of noisy uniform disk graphs. The bounds yield quasi-polynomial (nO(log n)) algorithms for all of the studied problems, while in the case of Hamiltonian Cycle and 3-Coloring we even get polynomial time algorithms. Furthermore, if the underlying noisy disks in ℍ2 have constant maximum degree, then all studied problems can be solved in polynomial time. This contrasts with the fact that these problems require  time under ETH in constant maximum degree Euclidean unit disk graphs. Finally, we complement our quasi-polynomial algorithm for Independent Set in noisy uniform disk graphs with a matching nΩ(log n) lower bound under ETH. This shows that the hyperbolic plane is a potential source of NP-intermediate problems.},

A growing discipline of ‘neurophilosophy’ brings fMRI evidence to bear on traditional philosophical issues such as weakness of will, moral psychology, rational choice, social interaction, free will, and consciousness. NI has also attracted critical attention from psychologists and from philosophers of science. I review debates over the evidential status of fMRI, including the differences between brain scans and ordinary images, the legitimacy of forward inference and reverse inference, and deductive versus probabilistic accounts of NI evidence. I conclude with a discussion of fMRI as exploratory rather than confirmatory evidence, linking this debate to the growing literature on cognitive ontology.},

In this paper I ask whether the aperspectivality of our warrants is a precondition for securing the objectivity of our claims. I draw upon a Sellarsian account of perception in order to argue that it is not; rather, inquirers can have contingent properties and perspectives that give them access to forms of rational warrant and objective knowledge that others do not have. The universal accessibility of reasons, on my account, is not a precondition for the legitimacy of any actual warrant, but rather a regulative ideal governing inquiry and communication.},

The values compare very favourably on a weight to weight basis with conventional materials such as mild steel and glass reinforced plastics. As the absolute values of modulus and strength of bamboo are higher than that of plastics, it has considerable potential as a reinforcement for these materials.},

The colonial past features especially prominently in the right wing-oriented press, where attempts to inform the public about the realities of colonialism are fiercely resisted in a ‘culture war’ against those labelled as ‘woke’. This culture war is sponsored in part by elements within the post-Brexit Conservative government and its conservative-nationalist-populist counterparts in other countries. Some of those who pursue it have enthusiastically welcomed Nigel Biggar’s Colonialism: A Moral Reckoning for giving the diminution and mitigation of British colonialism’s violence and racism the appearance of intellectual credibility. This article explores the political and psychological dimensions of this phenomenon and provides a detailed critique of Biggar’s book and its position within a historiography of imperial defensiveness. In the expectation that there are more culture war interpretations of the British Empire to come, I hope that it can act as something of a provisional guide for serious historians who are finding it increasingly difficult to avoid engagement with the contemporary politicisation of empire.},

  abstract = {The elucidations and regimentations of grounding offered in the literature standardly take it to be a necessary connection. In particular, authors often assert, or at least assume, that if some facts ground another fact, then the obtaining of the former necessitates the latter; and moreover, that grounding is an internal relation, in the sense of being necessitated by the existence of the relata. In this article, I challenge the necessitarian orthodoxy about grounding by offering two prima facie counterexamples. First, some physical facts may ground a certain phenomenal fact without necessitating it; and they may co-exist with the latter without grounding it. Second, some instantiations of categorical properties may ground the instantiation of a dispositional one without necessitating it; and they may co-exist without grounding it. After arguing that these may be genuine counterexamples, I ask whether there are modal constraints on grounding that are not threatened by them. I propose two: that grounding supervenes on what facts there are, and that every grounded fact supervenes on what grounds there are. Finally, I attempt to provide a rigorous formulation of the latter supervenience claim and discuss some technical questions that arise if we allow descending grounding chains of transfinite length.},

Parfit argues that what matters in survival is either identity or mental continuity and connectedness; that the two cannot both be what matters in survival (because the former is a one‐one relation and does not admit of degree, whereas the latter can admit of degree and may be a one‐many or many‐one relation); and that what matters in survival is not identity. Contra Parfit, Lewis contends that the opposition is a false one, since it obscures the fact that mental continuity and connectedness is a relation between two person‐stages (i.e., time‐slices of continuant persons), whereas identity is a relation between temporally extended continuant persons with stages at different times. The postscript includes both Lewis’ rejoinder to Parfit's objections, as well as a further defense of person‐stages.},

If you want to know what some new and different experience is like, you can learn it by going out and really having that experience. You can't learn it by being told about the experience, however thorough your lessons may be.Does this prove much of anything about the metaphysics of mind and the limits of science? I think not.Example: Skunks and Vegemite I have smelled skunks, so I know what it's like to smell skunks. But skunks live only in some parts of the world, so you may never have smelled a skunk. If you haven't smelled a skunk, then you don't know what it's like. You never will, unless someday you smell a skunk for yourself. On the other hand, you may have tasted Vegemite, that famous Australian substance; and I never have. So you may know what it's like to taste Vegemite. I don't, and unless I taste Vegemite (what, and spoil a good example!), I never will. It won't help at all to take lessons on the chemical composition of skunk scent or Vegemite, the physiology of the nostrils or the tastebuds, and the neurophysiology of the sensory nerves and the brain.Example: The Captive Scientist. Mary, a brilliant scientist, has lived from birth in a cell where everything is black or white. (Even she herself is painted all over.) She views the world on black-and-white television.},

The individual variation of gut microbiota contributes to the interindividual differences towards drug therapy including drug-induced toxicity and efficacy. Accordingly, the investigation and elucidation of gut microbial impacts on drug metabolism and toxicity will not only facilitate the way of personalized medicine, but also improve the rational drug design. Areas covered This review provide an overview on the microbiota-host cometabolism on drug metabolism and summarize 30 clinical drugs which are co-metabolized by host and gut microbiota. Moreover, this review is specifically focused on elucidating the gut microbial modulation on some clinical drugs, in which the gut microbial influences on drug metabolism, drug-induced toxicity and efficacy are intensively discussed. Expert opinion The gut microbial contribution to drug metabolism and toxicity is increasingly recognized, but remains largely unexplored due to the extremely complex relationship between gut microbiota and host. The mechanistic elucidation of gut microbiota in drug metabolism is critical before any practical progress in drug design or personalized medicine could be made by modulating human gut microbiota, which is predominantly relied on the technical innovations such as metagenomics and metabolomics, as well as the integration of multi-disciplinary knowledge.},

  abstract = {Given its unrivalled position in terms of diversity, distribution and uses, coupled with the vital role it plays in the rural economies of several countries around the world, bamboo has emerged in recent years as potentially the most important non-wood forest resource to replace wood in construction and other uses. Concomitantly, the interest being shown in this invaluable natural resource since the 1980s has resulted in the accumulation of a considerable body of information through research on various aspects of bamboos, including the anatomy of the bamboo culm. There is, however, no comprehensive publication available on the anatomy of bamboo culm, with the available literature being fragmented, scattered and inadequate. This landmark monograph by renowned wood biologist, forestry expert and bamboo specialist, Professor Walter Liese, whose innovative work on the study of anatomical structure using advanced microscopy and other techniques has won him wide international acclaim, fulfils the need for a comprehensive overview of current knowledge on this subject. It is the first attempt to synthesize information from studies on this subject, many of which have been contributed by Professor Liese, spread over the past four decades. By identifying gaps in the current anatomical knowledge base of bamboo culm, it is expected to stimulate further research and to act as a prime mover for knowledge generation in the key areas of bamboo anatomy, growth and taxonomy.},

I first argue that these challenges fail because they unduely assimilate mathematics to empirical science. Then I develop an improved challenge which is immune to this criticism. Very roughly, what I demand is an account of how people's mathematical beliefs are responsive to the truth of these beliefs. Finally I argue that if we employ a semantic truth-predicate rather than just a deflationary one, there surprisingly turns out to be logical space for a response to the improved challenge where no such space appeared to exist.},

Variations of the compressive strength against the physical properties of bamboo along the culms for both bamboo species were compared. A correlation of the average number of vascular bundle to the compressive strength of both bamboo species was developed. Findings indicate that the compressive strength of both Kao Zhu and Mao Zhu ranged between 45 and 65N/mm2 and the compressive strength of top section bamboo was higher than the bottom section. The fibre area of the top section bamboo was also found to be greater than bottom section bamboo from microstructure count of the sclerenchyma fibre within the vascular bundle of bamboo section. The microscopic examination of sclerenchyma fibre of bamboo section can be an alternative measure of the strength of bamboo for construction use.},

  abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of robust self-assembly and repair capabilities of complex systems would have enormous implications for basic evolutionary developmental biology as well as for transformative applications in regenerative biomedicine and the engineering of highly fault-tolerant cybernetic systems. Molecular biologists are working to identify the pathways underlying the remarkable regenerative abilities of model species that perfectly regenerate limbs, brains, and other complex body parts. However, a profound disconnect remains between the deluge of high-resolution genetic and protein data on pathways required for regeneration, and the desired spatial, algorithmic models that show how self-monitoring and growth control arise from the synthesis of cellular activities. This barrier to progress in the understanding of morphogenetic controls may be breached by powerful techniques from the computational sciences—using non-traditional modeling approaches to reverse-engineer systems such as planaria: flatworms with a complex bodyplan and nervous system that are able to regenerate any body part after traumatic injury. Currently, the involvement of experts from outside of molecular genetics is hampered by the specialist literature of molecular developmental biology: impactful collaborations across such different fields require that review literature be available that presents the key functional capabilities of important biological model systems while abstracting away from the often irrelevant and confusing details of specific genes and proteins. To facilitate modeling efforts by computer scientists, physicists, engineers, and mathematicians, we present a different kind of review of planarian regeneration. Focusing on the main patterning properties of this system, we review what is known about the signal exchanges that occur during regenerative repair in planaria and the cellular mechanisms that are thought to underlie them. By establishing an engineering-like style for reviews of the molecular developmental biology of biomedically important model systems, significant fresh insights and quantitative computational models will be developed by new collaborations between biology and the information sciences.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Working within a philosophical tradition that values tranquillity, Hume favors an epistemology that links justification with settled belief. Hume appeals to psychological stability to support his own epistemological assessments, both favorable regarding causal inference and unfavorable regarding the imagination. The theory's success in explaining Hume's epistemic distinctions gives way to pessimism or ”skepticism,” since Hume contends that reflection on beliefs is deeply destabilizing. So much the worse, Hume concludes, for placing a premium on reflection. Hume endorses and defends the position that stable beliefs of unreflective persons are justified, though they would not survive reflection. At the same time, Hume relishes, and strains to establish, the paradox that unreflective beliefs enjoy a preferred epistemic status. A series of amendments to the Treatise secures a more positive result for justified belief while maintaining Hume's fundamental principles. These include a stratum of psychological doctrine beyond associationism, a theory of conditions in which beliefs are felt to conflict and of the resolution of this uneasiness or dissonance. This theory of mental conflict is also essential to Hume's strategy for integrating empiricism about meaning with his naturalism. However, Hume fails to provide a general account of the conditions in which conflicting beliefs lead to persisting instability, so his theory is incomplete.},

  abstract = {Conventional wisdom has it that the sciences, properly pursued, constitute a pure, value-free method of obtaining knowledge about the natural world. In light of the social and normative dimensions of many scientific debates, Helen Longino finds that general accounts of scientific methodology cannot support this common belief. Focusing on the notion of evidence, the author argues that a methodology powerful enough to account for theories of any scope and depth is incapable of ruling out the influence of social and cultural values in the very structuring of knowledge. The objectivity of scientific inquiry can nevertheless be maintained, she proposes, by understanding scientific inquiry as a social rather than an individual process. Seeking to open a dialogue between methodologists and social critics of the sciences, Longino develops this concept of "contextual empiricism" in an analysis of research programs that have drawn criticism from feminists. Examining theories of human evolution and of prenatal hormonal determination of "gender-role" behavior, of sex differences in cognition, and of sexual orientation, the author shows how assumptions laden with social values affect the description, presentation, and interpretation of data. In particular, Longino argues that research on the hormonal basis of "sex-differentiated behavior" involves assumptions not only about gender relations but also about human action and agency. She concludes with a discussion of the relation between science, values, and ideology, based on the work of Habermas, Foucault, Keller, and Haraway},

There are two problems with this claim. First, the police have in some instances gone beyond international norms: they have beaten commuters on trains, collaborated with or at least turned a blind eye to triad violence against even those who were not involved in the protests, and routinely fired tear gas in dense residential areas. The police claimed that some protesters had changed clothes, as if that would justify thrashing people who were most likely uninvolved passengers. This would not be normal in most European states. Second, Hongkongers rightly expect higher standards than those in the West. That is because Hong Kong has surpassed the West in many respects. Would Lo wonder why there are complaints about MTR delays that would seem normal in London? Of course he wouldn’t, and that is why it is so ludicrous to think that Hongkongers’ higher expectations need an explanation. Perhaps many Europeans are resigned to the wanton excesses of their police; Hong Kong people aren’t yet. Lo also wonders why many seem to tolerate violence. I suggest he ask the chief executive. After all, the extradition amendment bill was suspended only after an unlawful assembly on June 12, when a peaceful march by a million people on June 9 had no such impact.

  abstract = {§0. Introduction. Ask a beginning philosophy of mathematics student why we believe the theorems of mathematics and you are likely to hear, “because we have proofs!” The more sophisticated might add that those proofs are based on true axioms, and that our rules of inference preserve truth. The next question, naturally, is why we believe the axioms, and here the response will usually be that they are “obvious”, or “self-evident”, that to deny them is “to contradict oneself” or “to commit a crime against the intellect”. Again, the more sophisticated might prefer to say that the axioms are “laws of logic” or “implicit definitions” or “conceptual truths” or some such thing.Unfortunately, heartwarming answers along these lines are no longer tenable (if they ever were). On the one hand, assumptions once thought to be self-evident have turned out to be debatable, like the law of the excluded middle, or outright false, like the idea that every property determines a set. Conversely, the axiomatization of set theory has led to the consideration of axiom candidates that no one finds obvious, not even their staunchest supporters. In such cases, we find the methodology has more in common with the natural scientist's hypotheses formation and testing than the caricature of the mathematician writing down a few obvious truths and preceeding to draw logical consequences.The central problem in the philosophy of natural science is when and why the sorts of facts scientists cite as evidence really are evidence. The same is true in the case of mathematics. Historically, philosophers have given considerable attention to the question of when and why various forms of logical inference are truth-preserving. The companion question of when and why the assumption of various axioms is justified has received less attention, perhaps because versions of the “self-evidence” view live on, and perhaps because of a complacent if-thenism.},

  abstract = {Bamboo is a ubiquitous monocotyledonous flowering plant and is a member of the true grass family Poaceae. In many parts of the world, it is widely used as a structural material especially in scaffolding and buildings. In spite of its wide use, there is no accepted methodology for standardizing a species of bamboo for a particular structural purpose. The task of developing structure–property correlations is complicated by the fact that bamboo is a hierarchical material whose structure at the nanoscopic level is not very well explored. However, we show that as far as stiffness is concerned, it is possible to obtain reliable estimates of important structural properties like the axial modulus from the knowledge of certain key elements of the microstructure. Stiffness of bamboo depends most sensitively on the size and arrangement of the fibre sheaths surrounding the vascular bundles and the arrangement of crystalline cellulose microfibrils in their secondary cell walls. For the species of bamboo studied in this work, we have quantitatively determined the radial gradation that the arrangement of fibres renders to the structure. The arrangement of the fibres gives bamboo a radially graded property variation across its cross section.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the basic principles of solar cell operation. Photovoltaic energy conversion in solar cells consists of two essential steps. First, absorption of light generates an electron–hole pair. Then, electron and hole are separated by the structure of the device; electrons to the negative terminal and holes to the positive terminal, thus generating electrical power. An ideal solar cell can be represented by a current source connected in parallel with a rectifying diode. The photogenerated current is closely related to the photon flux incident on the cell. It is usually independent of the applied voltage with possible exceptions in the case of a-Si and some other thin-film materials. This chapter discusses the basic concepts of electrical characteristics of solar cells, quantum efficiency, spectral response, and antireflection coating. Solar cell characteristics in practice are also discussed. The chapter elaborates the physical structure of the device, and the dominant electron transport processes that contribute to the energy conversion process. The chapter also explains concepts related to typical solar cell structures, including p–n junction solar cell, uniform emitter and base, diffused emitter, heterojunction cells, the p-i-n structure, and series resistance.},

One of the main reasons for these improvements has been the wide range of practical applications of SAT. Indeed, examples of modern applications of SAT range from termination analysis in term-rewrite systems to circuit-level prediction of crosstalk noise. The success of SAT solvers motivated many practical applications, but many practical applications have also provided the examples and the challenges that allowed the development of more efficient SAT solvers. This paper provides an overview of some of the most well-known applications of SAT and outlines several other successful applications of SAT. Moreover, the improvements in SAT solvers motivated the development of new algorithms for strategic extensions of SAT. As a result, the paper also provides a brief survey of recent work on extensions of SAT, including pseudo-Boolean constraints, maximum satisfiability, model counting and quantified Boolean formulas.},

There are no good logical, scientific, or philosophical arguments that cast doubt on the passing of time, and there are no impediments to representing in present physical theories that time passes.},

In this advertisement, Hume disavows the               Treatise               and directs all criticism to his later work. Hume himself is relatively clear as to why he preferred this later work. In his autobiography, when discussing the poor public reception given his               Treatise,               Hume says, ‘I had always entertained a Notion, that my want of Success in publishing the               Treatise of human nature,               had proceeded more from the manner than the matter; and that I had been guilty of a very usual Indiscretion, in going to the Press too early.’ In a letter to Gilbert Elliot, written in 1751, Hume says that ‘The philosophical Principles are the same in both’ the               Treatise               and the first               Enquiry.},

New evidence and new ways of looking at old evidence are now breaking the stalemate. Analysis of communications - the movements of people, ideas and things - is transforming our vision of Europe and the Mediterranean in the age of Charlemagne and Harun al Rashid. This is the first comprehensive analysis of the economic transition during this period for over sixty years. Using new materials and new methodology, it will attract all social and economic historians of antiquity and the middle ages, and anyone concerned with the origins of Europe, the history of the slave trade, medicine and disease, cross-cultural contacts, and the Muslim and Byzantine worlds.

His aim throughout is to identify the recalcitrant problems clearly, and to suggest fruitful approaches to their solutions, always avoiding facile answers.   The second edition of this classic book adds three completely new chapters on consciousness, mental content, and cognitive science, bringing it abreast of current developments.

The argument has only one rehearsal in print and it is quite subtle.

Emerging evidence of a role for gut microbiota on central nervous system functions therefore suggests that oral intake of probiotics may have beneficial consequences on mood and psychological distress. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anxiolytic-like activity of PF in rats, and its possible effects on anxiety, depression, stress and coping strategies in healthy human volunteers. In the preclinical study, rats were daily administered PF for 2 weeks and subsequently tested in the conditioned defensive burying test, a screening model for anti-anxiety agents. In the clinical trial, volunteers participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised parallel group study with PF administered for 30~d and assessed with the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-90), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Perceived Stress Scale, the Coping Checklist (CCL) and 24~h urinary free cortisol (UFC). Daily subchronic administration of PF significantly reduced anxiety-like behaviour in rats (P~{$<~$}0·05) and alleviated psychological distress in volunteers, as measured particularly by the HSCL-90 scale (global severity index, P~{$<~$}0·05; somatisation, P~{$<~$}0·05; depression, P~{$<~$}0·05; and anger–hostility, P~{$<~$}0·05), the HADS (HADS global score, P~{$<~$}0·05; and HADS-anxiety, P~{$<~$}0·06), and by the CCL (problem solving, P~{$<~$}0·05) and the UFC level (P~{$<~$}0·05). L. helveticus R0052 and B. longum R0175 taken in combination display anxiolytic-like activity in rats and beneficial psychological effects in healthy human volunteers.},

  abstract = {Ludwig Wittgenstein’s reflections onrule-following—principally, sections 138–242 ofPhilosophical Investigations and section VI of Remarks onthe Foundations of Mathematics—raise a series of provokingquestions and puzzles about the nature of language and thought. Theliterature on this topic is vast. We’ll structure our discussionaround Saul Kripke’s Wittgenstein on Rules and PrivateLanguage (1982), the most widely discussed commentary onWittgenstein on rule-following.[1] In this book, Kripke’s Wittgenstein famously develops a“sceptical challenge” to the idea that that there arefacts about the meanings of linguistic expressions and contents ofthoughts, and goes on to propose a “sceptical solution” tothe challenge, which attempts to preserve the propriety of talk ofmeaning and content while conceding to the sceptic the non-existenceof the kind of semantic or intentional facts on which she casts doubt.After some preliminary comments about rules, meaning, and content(§1), we’ll outline the sceptical argument (§2), andwe’ll offer an overview of some of the main responses to it.First, we’ll discuss sceptical responses of the sort proposed byKripke’s Wittgenstein himself (§3). Then, we’llconsider straight responses, which advance candidatemeaning-constituting facts. We’ll examine in detail the twoforms of straight solution that are most widely discussed in thesecondary literature, reductive dispositionalism (§4) andnon-reductionism (§5). , For the purposes of this entry, we’ll understand‘intentionality’ in a broad sense, so that it covers themeanings of linguistic expressions (and utterances) and also thecontents of propositional attitudes. Clearly, these notions areclosely related: just as we can say of the sentence ‘68+57=12568+ 57 = 12568+ 57 = 125’ that it meansthat 68 plus 57 is 125, we can say of Octavia’s beliefthat it has the content that 68 plus 57 is 125 (or thatOctavia believes that 68 plus 57 is 125).},

Rather, his philosophy is best seen as responding to a number of specific issues that captured his attention in the 1730s, mostly involving causation and thus explaining his particular enthusiasm for applying the Copy Principle to that idea. Other enthusiasms that shaped Book 1 of the Treatise (e.g., for sensory atomism and a crude theory of relations and mental acts) later faded, but the “Chief Argument” around causation—and causal/inductive inference—remains the consistent core of Hume’s theoretical philosophy through the Abstract and the many editions of the first Enquiry. In the Enquiry, moreover, Hume manages to tame the corrosive skepticism of the Treatise, enabling him to pursue his ambitions towards a naturalistic “science of man” while maintaining a discriminating skepticism towards aprioristic metaphysics and religion.},

I go on to suggest a diagnosis of these problems, according to which they would arise out of a view of agents too strongly dependent on the will. /// Este trabajo se ocupa de la concepción del autoconocimiento en el libro de Richard Moran Authority and Estrangement. Tras presentar las líneas maestras de dicha concepción, sostengo que ésta, a pesar de su novedad e interés, podría adolecer de defectos importantes. Así, con respecto a las creencias formadas mediante la deliberación, la propuesta de Moran parece enfrentarse a problemas de circularidad o de regreso. Y parece también insatisfactoria acerca de creencias no formadas de ese modo. Finalmente, sugiero un diagnóstico de estos problemas, según el cual éstos surgirían de una concepción de los agentes excesivamente dependiente de la voluntad.},

The corresponding list in the psychological literature on mental states includes one further member: the state of knowledge. This article examines why developmental, comparative, and social psychologists have classified knowledge as a mental state, while most recent philosophers—with the notable exception of Timothy Williamson—have not. The disagreement is traced back to a difference in how each side understands the relationship between the concepts of knowledge and belief, concepts which are understood in both disciplines to be closely linked. Psychologists and philosophers other than Williamson have generally disagreed about which of the pair is prior. The rival claims of priority are examined both in the light of philosophical arguments by Williamson and others, and in the light of empirical work on mental state attribution.},

  abstract = {Non-classical solutions to semantic paradox can be associated with conceptions of paradoxicality understood in terms of entailment facts. In a K3-based theory of truth, for example, it is prima facie natural to say that a sentence φ is paradoxical iff φ ∨ ¬φ entails an absurdity. In a recent paper, Julien Murzi and Lorenzo Rossi exploit this idea to introduce revenge paradoxes for a number of non-classical approaches, including K3. In this paper, I show that on no understanding of ‘is paradoxical’ (for K3) should both rules needed for their paradox be expected to hold unrestrictedly. Just which rule fails, however, depends on various factors, including whether the derivability relation of a target system of reasoning is arithmetically definable.},

  abstract = {Summary Controlling movements of flexible arms is a challenging task for the octopus because of the virtually infinite number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) [1, 2]. Octopuses simplify this control by using stereotypical motion patterns that reduce the DOFs, in the control space, to a workable few [2]. These movements are triggered by the brain and are generated by motor programs embedded in the peripheral neuromuscular system of the arm [3, 4, 5]. The hundreds of suckers along each arm have a tendency to stick to almost any object they contact [6, 7, 8, 9]. The existence of this reflex could pose significant problems with unplanned interactions between the arms if not appropriately managed. This problem is likely to be accentuated because it is accepted that octopuses are “not aware of their arms” [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Here we report of a self-recognition mechanism that has a novel role in motor control, restraining the arms from interfering with each other. We show that the suckers of amputated arms never attach to octopus skin because a chemical in the skin inhibits the attachment reflex of the suckers. The peripheral mechanism appears to be overridden by central control because, in contrast to amputated arms, behaving octopuses sometime grab amputated arms. Surprisingly, octopuses seem to identify their own amputated arms, as they treat arms of other octopuses like food more often than their own. This self-recognition mechanism is a novel peripheral component in the embodied organization of the adaptive interactions between the octopus’s brain, body, and environment [15, 16]. Video Abstract},

  abstract = {This chapter presents an argument for property dualism. The argument employs a distinction between having a concept of a property and grasping a property via a concept. If you grasp a property P via a concept C, then C is a concept of P. But the reverse does not hold: you may have a concept of a property without grasping that property via any concept. If you grasp a property, then your cognitive relation to that property is more intimate than if you just have some concept or other of that property. To grasp a property is to understand what having that property essentially consists in. To have a concept of a property is to have a concept one can use to attribute the property to something. If you have the concept of water, then you can use it to attribute the property of being water to liquids. You then have a concept of the property of being water. But you may have the concept of water without knowing that being composed of H2O is essential for being water — without knowing what having the property of being water consists in. In that case, your concept would not enable you to grasp the property. An account of grasping properties is proposed.},

It determines the range of grammatical hypothesis that children entertain during language learning and the procedure they use for evaluating input sentences. How universal grammar arose is a major challenge for evolutionary biology. We present a mathematical framework for the evolutionary dynamics of grammar learning. The central result is a coherence threshold, which specifies the condition for a universal grammar to induce coherent communication within a population. We study selection of grammars within the same universal grammar and competition between different universal grammars. We calculate the condition under which natural selection favors the emergence of rule-based, generative grammars that underlie complex language.},

  abstract = {Suppose that you are looking at a vase of flowers on the table in front of you. You can visually attend to the vase and to the flowers, noticing their different features: their colour, their shape and the way they are arranged. In attending to the vase, the flowers and their features, you are attending to mind-independent objects and features. Suppose, now, that you introspectively reflect on the visual experience you have when looking at the vase of flowers. In doing so, you might notice various features of your experience, for example that individual petals on the flowers are difficult to distinguish. Although in introspection your interest is in the character of your experience, your attention is still to the objects of your experience – to the mind-independent vase and the flowers. Since attending to your experience involves attending to the mind-independent objects and features of your experience, your experience seems introspectively to involve those mind-independent objects and features.2},

In this paper, I examine the assumptions that motivate Benacerraf s original challenge, and use them to construct a new causal challenge for the epistemology of mathematics. This new challenge, which I call 'Godel's Gap', appeals to intuitive insights into mathematical knowledge. Though it is a causal challenge, it does not rely on any obviously objectionable constraints on knowledge. As a result, it is more compelling than the original challenge. It is also more general; the challenge applies equally to platonistic and non-platonistic accounts of mathematical truth. And it can be generalized beyond the case of mathematical knowledge to pose a challenge for, e.g., moral knowledge.},

  abstract = {Objective To provide an accurate estimate of violent war deaths. Design Analysis of survey data on mortality, adjusted for sampling bias and censoring, from nationally representative surveys designed to measure population health. Estimated deaths compared with estimates in database of passive reports. Setting 2002-3 World health surveys, in which information was collected from one respondent per household about sibling deaths, including whether such deaths resulted from war injuries. Main outcome measure Estimated deaths from war injuries in 13 countries over 50 years. Results From 1955 to 2002, data from the surveys indicated an estimated 5.4 million violent war deaths (95\% confidence interval 3.0 to 8.7 million) in 13 countries, ranging from 7000 in the Democratic Republic of Congo to 3.8 million in Vietnam. From 1995 to 2002 survey data indicate 36 000 war deaths annually (16 000 to 71 000) in the 13 countries studied. Data from passive surveillance, however, indicated a figure of only a third of this. On the basis of the relation between world health survey data and passive reports, we estimate 378 000 globalwar deaths annually from 1985-94, the last years for which complete passive surveillance data were available. Conclusions The use of data on sibling history from peacetime population surveys can retrospectively estimate mortality from war. War causes more deaths than previously estimated, and there is no evidence to support a recent decline in war deaths.},

This article attempts to measure the contribution of trade with the periphery for the growth of output and the formation of capital at the core; takes up the issues of supernormal profits and externalities supposedly generated by this trade; explores the impact of imported bullion on the European money supply and concludes: "for the economic growth of the core the periphery was peripheral".}

Here, we show that in germ-free (GF) mice, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells accumulate in the colonic lamina propria and lung, resulting in increased morbidity in models of IBD and allergic asthma as compared with that of specific pathogen-free mice. This was associated with increased intestinal and pulmonary expression of the chemokine ligand CXCL16, which was associated with increased mucosal iNKT cells. Colonization of neonatal—but not adult—GF mice with a conventional microbiota protected the animals from mucosal iNKT accumulation and related pathology. These results indicate that age-sensitive contact with commensal microbes is critical for establishing mucosal iNKT cell tolerance to later environmental exposures.},

In place of the representational account, I then defend an equation of conscious sensory properties with intrinsic non-relational properties of subjects, and I show how this view deals naturally with all the difficulties facing representationalism. I conclude by defending this non-relational account of conscious experience against arguments from the ‘transparency’ and the ‘intrinsic intentionality’ of experience.},

Rather than offering a detailed commentary, the text provides an account based on specificity and critical scholarship, seeking to complement the other more comprehensive works on Hume's philosophy that had become available around the same time. This book will be of value to anyone with an interest in perspectives on Hume and Passmore's philosophical approach},

On the other, the proof of its unprovability is given in informal mathematics and proves that very sentence.

While I do not contest that his proof succeeds, my point is that he neglects the possibility that by similar methods it can be shown also that no non-empty set satisfies Cantor’s theorem. In this paper unrestricted abstraction based on a cut free Gentzen type sequential calculus will be employed to prove both results. In view of the connection between Priest’s three-valued logic of paradox and cut free Gentzen calculi this, a fortiori, has an impact on any paraconsistent set theory built on Priest’s logic of paradox.},

Arguments for overflow based on change-detection paradigms (e.g. Landman et al., 2003; Sligte et al., 2008) cannot be blocked in this way. However, such paradigms are fundamentally different from Sperling's and, for rather different reasons, equally fail to establish controversial claims about perceptual experience.},

A corollary of these is that the semantics of English must be paraconsistent. The first part of the paper formulates a definition of semantic closure which applies to natural languages and shows that this implies inconsistency. The second section argues that English is semeantically closed. The preceding discussion is predicated on the assumption that there are no truth value gaps. The next section of the paper considers whether the possibility of these makes any difference to the substantive conclusions of the previous sections, and argues that it does not. The crux of the preceding arguments is that none of the consistent semantical accounts that have been offered for solving the semantical paradoxes is a semantic of English. The final section of the paper produces a general argument as to why this must always be the case.},

  abstract = {In recent years, many people writing on set theory have invoked the notion of an indefinitely extensible concept. The notion, it is usually claimed, plays an important role in solving the paradoxes of absolute infinity. It is not clear, however, how the notion should be formulated in a coherent way, since it appears to run into a number of problems concerning, for example, unrestricted quantification. In fact, the notion makes perfectly good sense if one endorses a dialetheic solution to the paradoxes. It then morphs from a supposed solution to the paradoxes into a diagnosis of their structure. In this paper I show how.},

We studied and compared early bilinguals, simultaneous interpreters and monolingual controls to disentangle the effect of age of language acquisition from that of fluency, in the functional organization of the multilingual brain. The data suggest that a certain degree of interference takes place in the context of multiple languages because of the parallel access to different linguistic systems. There is less interference if one of the languages has a special status. Age of acquisition seems to be more relevant than proficiency in determining a different linguistic cerebral organization between monolinguals and polyglots. It appears that the linguistic systems (L1, L2, L3, etc.), are not independent but rather are based on a common conceptual system.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human gut is an ecosystem consisting of a great number of commensal bacteria living in symbiosis with the host. Several data confirm that gut microbiota is engaged in a dynamic interaction with the intestinal innate and adaptive immune system, affecting different aspects of its development and function. AIM: To review the immunological functions of gut microbiota and improve knowledge of its therapeutic implications for several intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases associated to dysregulation of the immune system. METHODS: Significant articles were identified by literature search and selected based on content, including atopic diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases and treatment of these conditions with probiotics. RESULTS: Accumulating evidence indicates that intestinal microflora has protective, metabolic, trophic and immunological functions and is able to establish a "cross-talk" with the immune component of mucosal immunity, comprising cellular and soluble elements. When one or more steps in this fine interaction fail, autoimmune or auto-inflammatory diseases may occur. Furthermore, it results from the data that probiotics, used for the treatment of the diseases caused by the dysregulation of the immune system, can have a beneficial effect by different mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Gut microbiota interacts with both innate and adaptive immune system, playing a pivotal role in maintenance and disruption of gut immune quiescence. A cross talk between the mucosal immune system and endogenous microflora favours a mutual growth, survival and inflammatory control of the intestinal ecosystem. Based on these evidences, probiotics can be used as an ecological therapy in the treatment of immune diseases.},

Thanks to the work of contemporary transformational linguists,† a very subtle description of at least some human languages is in the process of being constructed. Some features of these languages appear to be universal. Where such features turn out to be ‘species-specific’ – ‘not explicable on some general grounds of functional utility or simplicity that would apply to arbitrary systems that serve the functions of language’ – they may shed some light on the structure of mind. While it is extremely difficult to say to what extent the structure so illuminated will turn out to be a universal structure of language, as opposed to a universal structure of innate general learning strategies,‡ the very fact that this discussion can take place is testimony to the richness and generality of the descriptive material that linguists are beginning to provide, and also testimony to the depth of the analysis, insofar as the features that appear to be candidates for ‘species-specific’ features of language are in no sense surface or phenomenological features of language, but lie at the level of deep structure.The most serious drawback to all of this analysis, as far as a philosopher is concerned, is that it does not concern the meaning of words.},

Specifically, I shall try to show that all of the issues arise in connection with any computing system capable of answering questions about its own structure, and have thus nothing to do with the unique nature (if it is unique) of human subjective experience.To illustrate the sort of thing that is meant: one kind of puzzle that is sometimes discussed in connection with the ‘mind–body problem’ is the puzzle of privacy. The question ‘How do I know I have a pain?’ is a deviant† (‘logically odd’) question. The question ‘How do I know Smith has a pain?’ is not all at deviant. The difference can also be mirrored in impersonal questions: ‘How does anyone ever know he himself has a pain?’ is deviant; ‘How does anyone ever know that someone else is in pain?’ is non-deviant. I shall show that the difference in status between the last two questions is mirrored in the case of machines: if T is a Turing machine (see below), the question ‘How does T ascertain that it is in state A?’},

  abstract = {First published in Chinese in 1964 and then banned by the revolutionaries ten years later, this remarkable autobiography presents the story of a man who served twice as emperor of China, once as emperor of the Japanese puppet state in Manchuria, and then underwent a complete re-education in the prisons of the Communist Chinese government, finally leading a life as an ordinary citizen. Placed on the throne in 1908 at the age of two, Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi became the tenth ruler of the Ch'ing Dynasty and the last emperor of China. Forced to abdicate four years later but permitted to remain in the Forbidden City until the Ch'ing court lost power in 1924, Pu Yi spent his youth surrounded by eunuchs, princes, cooks, consorts, tutors, and the decadent, often wild excesses of the Imperial Palace. During this time, Reginald Johnston, a Scottish district officer and magistrate of the British-leased territory of Weihaiwei in Shantung, became Pu Yi's tutor and established a bond with the young emperor that both remembered fondly in their writings. Recounting those early days, Pu Yi then describes his installation by the Japanese as puppet emperor in Manchuria, the defeat of Japan by the Allies in World War II, his imprisonment in the Soviet Union, and his eventual forced return to the People's Republic of China in 1950. Re-educated in Chinese prisons, Pu Yi learned how to dress himself, work on an assembly line, and criticize his former uselessness and pride. Pu Yi ends the account with his release from prison--pardoned by the Communist Party--and the beginning of his new life as a gardener and then as a researcher of literary and historical materials. This fascinating account not only depicts an empire in the throes of death and the zeal of a new-born regime, but also reveals the tragic story of a man who was a helpless subject of family and government turmoils and not really a ruler at all. W.J. Jenner has written a general introduction and individual introductions to each chapter, giving the history of the book and its political background. Simon Winchester has contributed an afterword on Chinese reactions to the empire and to the making of Bernardo Bertolucci's film about Pu Yi, due to release in November.},

  abstract = {Although the study of visual perception has made more progress in the past 40 years than any other area of cognitive science, there remain major disagreements as to how closely vision is tied to cognition. This target article sets out some of the arguments for both sides (arguments from computer vision, neuroscience, psychophysics, perceptual learning, and other areas of vision science) and defends the position that an important part of visual perception, corresponding to what some people have called early vision, is prohibited from accessing relevant expectations, knowledge, and utilities in determining the function it computes--in other words, it is cognitively impenetrable. That part of vision is complex and involves top-down interactions that are internal to the early vision system. Its function is to provide a structured representation of the 3-D surfaces of objects sufficient to serve as an index into memory, with somewhat different outputs being made available to other systems such as those dealing with motor control. The paper also addresses certain conceptual and methodological issues raised by this claim, such as whether signal detection theory and event-related potentials can be used to assess cognitive penetration of vision. A distinction is made among several stages in visual processing, including, in addition to the inflexible early-vision stage, a pre-perceptual attention-allocation stage and a post-perceptual evaluation, selection, and inference stage, which accesses long-term memory. These two stages provide the primary ways in which cognition can affect the outcome of visual perception. The paper discusses arguments from computer vision and psychology showing that vision is "intelligent" and involves elements of "problem solving." The cases of apparently intelligent interpretation sometimes cited in support of this claim do not show cognitive penetration; rather, they show that certain natural constraints on interpretation, concerned primarily with optical and geometrical properties of the world, have been compiled into the visual system. The paper also examines a number of examples where instructions and "hints" are alleged to affect what is seen. In each case it is concluded that the evidence is more readily assimilated to the view that when cognitive effects are found, they have a locus outside early vision, in such processes as the allocation of focal attention and the identification of the stimulus.},

Here is another critical issue in Hume scholarship: What is the relationship between Hume’s scepticism and his naturalism? How can we reconcile Hume’s extreme brand of scepticism with his positive ambitions of providing an account of human nature? Hume’s Epistemological Evolution argues that these two issues are intimately related. In particular, this book argues that Hume’s Enquiry indeed differs from the Treatise, precisely because he changes his response to scepticism between the two works. Because the Treatise has as its primary focus the psychological naturalistic project, its treatment of epistemological issues arises unsystematically from the psychological investigation. Consequently, Hume finds himself forced into an unsatisfactory response to scepticism founded on the Title Principle . This response is, however, deeply problematic, as Hume himself seems to recognise. In contrast to the Treatise, the Enquiry emphasises the epistemological aspects of Hume’s project, and offers a radically different and more sophisticated epistemology. This framework addresses the weaknesses of the earlier one, and also constitutes a ‘compleat answer’ to two of his most prominent critics, Thomas Reid and James Beattie. Hume’s epistemology thus undergoes an evolution between these two works.},

  abstract = {In Pursuit of Truth W. V. Quine gives us his latest word on issues to which he has devoted many years. As he says in the preface: “In these pages I have undertaken to update, sum up, and clarify my variously intersecting views on cognitive meaning, objective reference, and the grounds of knowledge.” The pursuit of truth is a quest that links observation, theory, and the world. Various faulty efforts to forge such links have led to much intellectual confusion. Quine’s efforts to get beyond the confusion begin by rejecting the very idea of binding together word and thing, rejecting the focus on the isolated word. For him, observation sentences and theoretical sentences are the alpha and omega of the scientific enterprise. Notions like “idea” and ”meaning” are vague, but a sentence—now there’s something you can sink your teeth into. Starting thus with sentences, Quine sketches an epistemological setting for the pursuit of truth. He proceeds to show how reification and reference contribute to the elaborate structure that can indeed relate science to its sensory evidence. In this book Quine both summarizes and moves ahead. Rich, lively chapters dissect his major concerns: evidence, reference, meaning, intention, and truth. “Some points,” he writes, “have become clearer in my mind in the eight years since Theories and Things. Some that were already clear in my mind have become clearer on paper. And there are some that have meanwhile undergone substantive change for the better.” This is a key book for understanding the effort that a major philosopher has made a large part of his life’s work: to naturalize epistemology in the twentieth century. The book is concise and elegantly written, as one would expect, and does not assume the reader’s previous acquaintance with Quine’s writings. Throughout, it is marked by Quine’s wit and economy of style.},

They concern the limits of provability in formalaxiomatic theories. The first incompleteness theorem states that inany consistent formal system FFF within which a certain amount ofarithmetic can be carried out, there are statements of the language ofFFF which can neither be proved nor disproved in FFF.According to the second incompleteness theorem, such a formal systemcannot prove that the system itself is consistent (assuming it isindeed consistent). These results have had a great impact on thephilosophy of mathematics and logic. There have been attempts to applythe results also in other areas of philosophy such as the philosophyof mind, but these attempted applications are more controversial. Thepresent entry surveys the two incompleteness theorems and variousissues surrounding them.

By suggesting an alternative way of understanding objectivity, an attempt is made to show that one can accept the implications of Marx's social theory and yet still hold that scientific inquiry is objective in an epistemically appropriate sense--not in spite of, but in large measure because of, the role Marx assigns science within the capitalist division of labor.}

Part of what Marx means by ‘ideal expression’ is revealed when he argues that ruling ideas have a legitimating function: a ruling class must “represent its Interest as the conmon interest”, “give its ideas the form of universality, ana represent them as the only rational, universally valid ones.” (1846, pp. 65-66).             The idea that scientific inquiry is objective is unquestionably among the ruling ideas of our epoch, and it represents science as serving not the Interests of a particular class, but a purely general interest in the understanding of nature.},

What about the idea that only mental states are intentional? In his 2008 paper published in Analysis, Nes shows that on a popular characterization of intentionality, notably defended by Crane (2014 [1998], 2001), some non-mental states come out as intentional. Crane (2008) replies that the concept of representation solves the problem. In this paper, I argue that no representational account of intentionality meets Nes’s challenge. After distinguishing between two notions of representation, I contend that there are two versions of Crane’s representational account, but neither of them is able to solve the problem posed by Nes.},

Agustin Rayo and Gabriel Uzquiano have assembled a distinguished team of contributors to write new essays on the topic. They investigate the question of whether it is possible to attain absolute generality in thought and language and the ramifications of this question in the philosophy of logic and mathematics. -;Is it possible to quantify over absolutely all there is? Or must all of our quantifiers range over a less-than-all-inclusive domain? It has commonly been thought that the question of absolute generality is intimately connected with the set-theoretic antinomies. But the topic of absolute generality has enjoyed a surge of interest in recent years. It has become increasingly apparent that its ramifications extend well beyond the foundations of set theory. Connections include semantic. indeterminacy, logical consequence, higher-order languages, and metaphysics. Rayo and Uzquiano present for the first time a collection of essays on absolute generality. These newly commissioned articles -- written by an impressive array of international scholars -- draw the reader into the forefront of contemporary research on the subject. The volume represents a variety of approaches to the problem, with some of the contributions arguing for the possibility of all-inclusive quantification and some of them arguing against it. An introduction by the editors draws a. helpful map of the philosophical terrain. -},

  abstract = {The language of thought hypothesis (LOTH) proposes thatthinking occurs in a mental language. Often called Mentalese,the mental language resembles spoken language in several key respects:it contains words that can combine into sentences; the words andsentences are meaningful; and each sentence’s meaning depends ina systematic way upon the meanings of its component words and the waythose words are combined. For example, there is a Mentaleseword whale that denotes whales, and there is aMentalese word mammal that denotesmammals. These words can combine into a Mentalesesentence whales are mammals, which means thatwhales are mammals. To believe that whales are mammals is to bear anappropriate psychological relation to this sentence. During aprototypical deductive inference, I might transform the Mentalesesentence whales are mammals and the Mentalesesentence Moby Dick is a whale into theMentalese sentence Moby Dick is a mammal. As Iexecute the inference, I enter into a succession of mental states thatinstantiate those sentences., LOTH emerged gradually through the writings of Augustine, Boethius,Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, and many others. William of Ockhamoffered the first systematic treatment in his Summa Logicae(c. 1323), whichmeticulously analyzed the meaning and structure of Mentaleseexpressions. LOTH was quite popular during the late medieval era, butit slipped from view in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Fromthat point through the mid-twentieth century, it played little seriousrole within theorizing about the mind., In the 1970s, LOTH underwent a dramatic revival. The watershed waspublication of Jerry Fodor’s The Language of Thought(1975). Fodor argued abductively: our current best scientific theoriesof psychological activity postulate Mentalese; we therefore have goodreason to accept that Mentalese exists. Fodor’s analysis exertedtremendous impact. LOTH once again became a focus of discussion, somesupportive and some critical. Debates over the existence and nature ofMentalese continue to figure prominently within philosophy andcognitive science. These debates have pivotal importance for ourunderstanding of how the mind works.},

  abstract = {Many compelling examples have recently been provided in which people can achieve impressive epistemic success, e.g. draw highly accurate inferences, by using simple heuristics and very little information. This is possible by taking advantage of the features of the environment. The examples suggest an easy and appealing naturalization of rationality: on the one hand, people clearly can apply simple heuristics, and on the other hand, they intuitively ought do so when this brings them high accuracy at little cost.. The ‘ought-can’ principle is satisfied, and rationality is meaningfully normative. We show, however, that this naturalization program is endangered by a computational wrinkle in the adaptation process taken to be responsible for this heuristics-based (‘ecological’) rationality: for the adaptation process to guarantee even minimal rationality, it requires astronomical computational resources, making the problem intractable. We consider various plausible auxiliary assumptions in attempt to remove this obstacle, and show that they do not succeed; intractability is a robust property of adaptation. We discuss the implications of our findings for the project of naturalizing rationality.},

In the decadessince the term ‘module’ and its cognates first entered thelexicon of cognitive science, the conceptual and theoretical landscapein this area has changed dramatically. Especially noteworthy in thisrespect has been the development of evolutionary psychology, whoseproponents adopt a less stringent conception of modularity than theone advanced by Fodor, and who argue that the architecture of the mindis more pervasively modular than Fodor claimed. Where Fodor (1983,2000) draws the line of modularity at the relatively low-level systemsunderlying perception and language, post-Fodorian theorists such asSperber (2002) and Carruthers (2006) contend that the mind is modularthrough and through, up to and including the high-level systemsresponsible for reasoning, planning, decision making, and the like.The concept of modularity has also figured in recent debates inphilosophy of science, epistemology, ethics, and philosophy oflanguage—further evidence of its utility as a tool fortheorizing about mental architecture.},

  abstract = {It is not uncommon among theorists favoring a deviant logic on account of the semantic paradoxes to subscribe to an idea that has come to be known as ‘classical recapture’. The main thought underpinning it is that non-classical logicians are justified in endorsing many instances of the classically valid principles that they reject. Classical recapture promises to yield an appealing pair of views: one can attain naivety for semantic concepts while retaining classicality in ordinary domains such as mathematics. However, Julien Murzi and Lorenzo Rossi have recently suggested that revisionary approaches to truth breed revenge paradoxes when they are coupled with the thought that classical reasoning can be recaptured in certain circumstances. What’s novel about the paradoxes they put forward is that they cannot be dismissed so easily. The concepts used to generate these paradoxes—those of paradoxicality and unparadoxicality—are concepts that non-classical theorists need in order to offer a diagnosis of the truth-theoretic paradoxes. My goal in this paper is to argue that non-classical theorists can represent the concept of paradoxicality without falling prey to revenge paradoxes. In particular, I will show how to provide a formal fixed-point semantics for a language extended with a paradoxicality predicate that adequately expresses the non-classical logician’s notion of paradoxicality.},

Is there a difference in the way Descartes and Rohault deal with experiments? I state that there is no doctrinal difference between them: the experiments they carry out are of the same order; they attribute the same epistemological functions to them; they share the same ontology. The main difference between them is that, unlike Descartes, Rohault made experiments a means of popularization of the Cartesian philosophy. 2. How does Rohault treat experiments in his Mercredis? Studying quite closely the evolution that led to the greater priority attributed to experiments in the scientific circles that prefigure the Académie des sciences, I show that, in 1660s France, the treatment Rohault give to experiments in his Mercredis is exceeded by the radical experimentalism of the other French learned societies. 3. Did this radical experimentalism bring out a transformation of of Cartesianism? I establish that, while the first criticism to Descartes concerns his dogmatic pretentions, there emerges in the last thirty years of the seventeenth century what has since become a historiographic cliché, the idea that Cartesians neglected experiments in favor of hypotheses and speculation.},

  abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical widely used as a monomer in the production of polymers of plastics. It acts as an endocrine-disrupting agent and thus its contaminations of food and beverage should be carefully monitored in order to assess consumers’ risk. In this study, we propose a liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (LC-FD)-validated method for the simultaneous determination of BPA and seven analogues, i.e., bisphenol AF, bisphenol B, bisphenol E, bisphenol F, BPA diglycidyl ether, bisphenol F diglycidyl ether, and Bisphenol M in soft drinks. A one-step solid-phase extraction (SPE) was effective at reducing the interferences, obtaining good purification of the samples, and consequently good recoveries of all analytes. The separation was obtained on a C18 column by using acetonitrile/water 55:45 (v/v) under isocratic conditions. Method validation was performed according to the European Commission Decision 2002/657/EC criteria, providing good results regarding the analytical parameters of linearity, selectivity, sensitivity, precision, recovery, decision limit (CCα), detection capability (CCβ), limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), stability, and robustness. The method allows the detection of BPA and BADGE at levels much lower than their legal limits in the food, which are 0.06 and 9.00~mg~kg−1, respectively.},

Theoretical virtues matter not only for choosing theories 'to work with', but also for what we are justified in believing: only if the theories we possess are good ones (qua virtues) can we be confident that our theories' claims about nature are actually correct. Recent debates have focussed rather narrowly on a theory's capacity to predict new phenomena successfully, but Schindler argues that the justification for this focus is thin. He discusses several other theory properties such as testability, accuracy, and consistency, and highlights the importance of simplicity and coherence. Using detailed historical case studies and careful philosophical analysis, Schindler challenges the received view of theoretical virtues and advances arguments for the view that science uncovers reality through theory.},

  abstract = {David Hume’s philosophy, especially the positive project of his“science of man”, is often thought to be modeled onNewton’s successes in natural philosophy. Hume’sself-described “experimental method” (see the subtitle toTreatise) and the resemblance of his “rules ofreasoning” (THN 1.3.15)[1] with Newton’s are said to be evidence for this position (Noxon1973; Stroud 1977; de Pierris 2002; Penelhum 2000; Bennett 2001;Beebee 2006; Hazony 2014; Demeter 2016 etc.). Hume encourages thisview of his project by employing Newtonian metaphors: he talks of an“attraction” in the “mental world” on a parwith that in the “natural world” (THN 1.1.4.6). Humeinfers the existence of “habits” as a kind of mental“force” (EHU 5.22) analogous to gravity; the discovery of“the principles of association”, which in the Abstracthe calls his most important achievement (see the section on association in the entry on Hume), are, then, analogous to the laws of motion. Hume certainly appears towant his readers to feel that he is modeling his project on thesuccesses of natural philosophy, exemplified by Newton. In the“Introduction” to the Treatise and even moreexplicitly in the opening pages of Enquiry (EHU 1.15), Humesuggests that his “science of man” can parallel recentachievements in natural philosophy (with rather obvious nods toNewton’s successes in planetary astronomy). And at the start ofEPM (1.10), he echoes Newton’s rejection of“hypotheses”, and restates his allegiance to theexperimental method in contrast with its speculative alternative (onthe contrast see Anstey 2005). There is, thus, no doubt that Humewants his readers to believe that Newton forms a kind of model.},

I will argue that internalists needn't appeal to any kind of privileged access claims.

If she then also accepts rabbit consciousness, she ought to accept the possibility of consciousness even in rather dumb group entities. Finally, the United States would seem to be a rather dumb group entity of the relevant sort.

More than anything else, he argues, it is the neglect of consciousness that results in so much barrenness and sterility in psychology, the philosophy of mind, and cognitive science: there can be no study of mind that leaves out consciousness. What is going on in the brain is neurophysiological processes and consciousness and nothing more—no rule following, no mental information processing or mental models, no language of thought, and no universal grammar. Mental events are themselves features of the brain, "like liquidity is a feature of water."Beginning with a spirited discussion of what's wrong with the philosophy of mind, Searle characterizes and refutes the philosophical tradition of materialism. But he does not embrace dualism. All these "isms" are mistaken, he insists. Once you start counting types of substance you are on the wrong track, whether you stop at one or two. In four chapters that constitute the heart of his argument, Searle elaborates a theory of consciousness and its relation to our overall scientific world view and to unconscious mental phenomena. He concludes with a criticism of cognitive science and a proposal for an approach to studying the mind that emphasizes the centrality of consciousness to any account of mental functioning.In his characteristically direct style, punctuated with persuasive examples, Searle identifies the very terminology of the field as the main source of truth. He observes that it is a mistake to suppose that the ontology of the mental is objective and to suppose that the methodology of a science of the mind must concern itself only with objectively observable behavior; that it is also a mistake to suppose that we know of the existence of mental phenomena in others only by observing their behavior; that behavior or causal relations to behavior are not essential to the existence of mental phenomena; and that it is inconsistent with what we know about the universe and our place in it to suppose that everything is knowable by us.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT In the United States, chronic wounds affect 6.5 million patients. An estimated excess of US\$25 billion is spent annually on treatment of chronic wounds and the burden is rapidly growing due to increasing health care costs, an aging population and a sharp rise in the incidence of diabetes and obesity worldwide. The annual wound care products market is projected to reach \$15.3 billion by 2010. Chronic wounds are rarely seen in individuals who are otherwise healthy. In fact, chronic wound patients frequently suffer from "highly branded" diseases such as diabetes and obesity. This seems to have overshadowed the significance of wounds per se as a major health problem. For example, NIH's Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tool (RePORT; http://report.nih.gov/), directed at providing access to estimates of funding for various disease conditions does list several rare diseases but does not list wounds. Forty million inpatient surgical procedures were performed in the United States in 2000, followed closely by 31.5 million outpatient surgeries. The need for post-surgical wound care is sharply on the rise. Emergency wound care in an acute setting has major significance not only in a war setting but also in homeland preparedness against natural disasters as well as against terrorism attacks. An additional burden of wound healing is the problem of skin scarring, a \$12 billion annual market. The immense economic and social impact of wounds in our society calls for allocation of a higher level of attention and resources to understand biological mechanisms underlying cutaneous wound complications.},

  abstract = {Could the gut microbiome have a critical role in brain and behavior? The notion is starting to gain acceptance amongst both researchers and funders.  Of all of the journal articles that neuroscientist Jane Foster has written in the past 10 years, one stands out. “It was the hardest paper I’d ever published in my life,” says Foster, a professor at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada. Her 2011 study in Neurogastroenterology and Motility showed that mice produced and raised without gut bacteria display changes in anxiety-like behaviors (1). The findings supported a relatively new, and to some researchers, radical, theory: that intestinal microbes can influence the mind. Foster’s manuscript met with skepticism from many reviewers, taking two years to reach publication. Early work suggests the gut microbiome could have important effects on the brain and behavior. Image courtesy of Dave Cutler. But times are changing, says Foster. Most of her papers now take a more conventional four to six months to publish, bolstered by a growing number of studies in the field from Foster’s laboratory and others. Mounting evidence, mostly from rodent studies, suggests that gut microbes help shape normal neural development, brain biochemistry, and behavior, especially in relation to stress, anxiety, and depression. Disruptions to gut bacteria, some researchers believe, could play a role in certain neuropsychiatric disorders and might even point to new treatments or ways of improving existing ones. Still, scientists will have to clarify the mechanisms at work and clearly demonstrate cause and effect before the microbiome gains acceptance as a target for treating brain diseases. Numerous studies are either depleting members of the microbiota or boosting their numbers in hopes of gleaning insights into the cascade of effects on the brain. “It could turn out that this is just the latest kid on the block and …},

The plot of v versus the allosteric activator (AMP) concentration have very complicated shapes: there are several inflection points, and also the maximum at L-threonine concentration equal to 3-10(2) and 5-10(-2) M. High AMP concentrations inhibit the enzyme at high substrate concentrations. The reduced glutathion dose not influence the enzyme and does not alter the activating effect of AMP. On the basis of the data obtained it is proposed that the substrate and AMP shift the equilibrium between multiple oligomeric enzyme forms differing in catalytic activity and kinetic manifestations of allosteric interactions between the active and allosteric AMP-binding sites towards polymerization. Thus, the functioning the enzyme under study is discussed in the frames of the model of dissociating regulatory enzymes with multiple intermediate oligomeric forms.},

  abstract = {Introduction. This paper examines the sociocultural implications of a bilin- gual education with English as an official language in the small city-state and Southeast Asian nation called Singapore. Since its founding in 1819, Singapura, or the Lion City, has been a multilingual society, prompting the country's leaders to adopt a proactive policy of multilingualism when independence was achieved in 1965. Four official languages (English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil) were con- stitutionally enshrined. Today, Singapore's three million people live in a largely metropolitan setting on 680 square kilometers of land. Owing to the high degree of daily interaction in an urban multilingual context, Singaporeans are generally bilingual if not multilingual. Most of the people are what I call English-knowing bilinguals, that is, they are exposed to English to a large extent and use it as a working language in most public spheres of life. This paper examines two issues that have arisen as a result of Singapore's successful bilingual language management, with English as a cornerstone of the bilingual policy. Two questions are posed: As its global and local importance in- creases, can English serve as a language of national identity for Singaporeans? What is the sociocultural price to be paid for placing English as the premier co- official language? A sociolinguistic profile of Singapore and the education system. To con- textualize language policy in Singapore, a sociolinguistic profile of the republic and a thumbnail sketch of the education system need to be given. The languages of Singapore represent a hodgepodge drawn from the three identifiable ethnic groups, Chinese (77\%), Malay (15\%), and Indian (7\%), and from other groups such as the Eurasians, Armenians, Jews, and Parsees (1\%). The four official lan- guages are English, Malay (also the de jure national language), Mandarin, and Tamil, all belonging to different language families and having different literary traditions. In addition to Tamil (which is an official language), Malayalam and Telegu are the two other Dravidian languages spoken in Singapore. Five other South Asian ethnic languages are represented in the school system: Hindi, Urdu,}

Some involve privileging one foliation of spacetime by instants, as the instants along which presentness moves. It is argued that theories like this face an underdetermination problem. An alternative strategy is defended: take the kind of region that is present to be a single point of spacetime, rather than an instant. The chapter concludes by discussing how the physics beyond special relativity bears on the question which version of the moving spotlight theory is best.},

  abstract = {Debates over the economic, social, and political meaning of slavery and the slave trade have persisted for over two hundred years. The Atlantic Slave Trade brings clarity and critical insight to the subject. In fourteen essays, leading scholars consider the nature and impact of the transatlantic slave trade and assess its meaning for the people transported and for those who owned them.Among the questions these essays address are: the social cost to Africa of this forced migration; the role of slavery in the economic development of Europe and the United States; the short-term and long-term effects of the slave trade on black mortality, health, and life in the New World; and the racial and cultural consequences of the abolition of slavery. Some of these essays originally appeared in recent issues of Social Science History; the editors have added new material, along with an introduction placing each essay in the context of current debates. Based on extensive archival research and detailed historical examination, this collection constitutes an important contribution to the study of an issue of enduring significance. It is sure to become a standard reference on the Atlantic slave trade for years to come.Contributors. Ralph A. Austen, Ronald Bailey, William Darity, Jr., Seymour Drescher, Stanley L.

A 460 (2004) 1535] had claimed to have a scheme showing how, in principle, physical “quantum adiabatic systems” could be used to solve the prototypical computationally undecidable problem, Turing’s “halting problem”, in finite time, with success probability {$>$}2/3 (where this 2/3 is independent of the input halting problem). There were several errors in those papers, most which ultimately could be corrected. More seriously, we here exhibit counterexamples to a crucial step in Kieu’s argument. The counterexamples are small quantum adiabatic systems in which “decoy” nonground states arise with high probability ({$>$}99.999\%). Kieu had wrongly claimed no decoy state could ever acquire occupation probability greater than 50\%. These counterexamples destroy Kieu’s entire plan and there seems no way to correct the plan to escape them. Nevertheless, there are some important consequences salvageable from Kieu’s idea: we can prove that the “halflife” of Kieu’s quantum systems is uncomputably large and no fully general form of the quantum adiabatic theorem can exist that yields computable upper bounds on adiabatic convergence times (both unless Church’s thesis is false so that finite time adiabatic quantum system evolution is unsimulable); and we can prove that no algorithm exists to find the ground-state energy of Kieu’s class of quantum Hamiltonians and hence their long-term thermal behavior is uncomputable.},

  abstract = {Azad Jammu and Kashmir (also known as "Free Kashmir") is the southernmost political entity within the Pakistani-administered part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. Christopher Snedden offers a rare history of the territory's largely forgotten people and the conflict that continues to define their status within the nation. He contends that in October 1947, pro-Pakistan Muslims in southwestern Jammu and Kashmir initiated the Kashmir dispute, not Pashtun tribesmen invading from Pakistan, which is India's official narrative. Later named Azad Kashmiris, these people, Snedden argues, are legitimate stakeholders in this conflict and have very much inherited its legacy. Snedden en critically reexamines Azad Kashmir's administrative structures, economic and political systems, and subordinate relationship with Pakistan, particularly in the years following the Kashmir dispute. Azad Kashmiris believed their administration was the only legitimate government in the region, and they expected to rule Jammu and Kashmir after its reunification by the United Nations. However, contrary to expectations, Azad Kashmir effectively, if not legally, became a (dependent) part of Pakistan. Long disenchanted with Islamabad, some Azad Kashmiris now favor independence for Jammu and Kashmir and hope to prosper without help from their neighbors. In his conclusion, Snedden assesses different ways to resolve Azad Kashmir's international status and the outstanding claims of the Kashmir dispute.},

This book evaluates the principle and discusses its many applications. Fascinating examples from different domains provide a rich basis for contemplating the principle's promises and perils. It is obvious that simpler theories are beautiful and easy to understand; the hard problem is to figure out why the simplicity of a theory should be relevant to saying what the world is like. In this book, the ABCs of probability theory are succinctly developed and put to work to describe two 'parsimony paradigms' within which this problem can be solved.},

Defenders of the luminous overwhelmingly object to the argument's use of a certain margin-for-error premise. Williamson himself claims that the premise follows easily from a safety condition on knowledge together with his description of the thought experiment. But luminists argue that this is not so: the margin-for-error premise either requires an implausible interpretation of the safety requirement on knowledge, or it requires other equally implausible (and soritical) assumptions. In this paper I bolster the margin-for-error premise against these attacks by recasting Williamson's own two-part defence, the first part intended to work on the assumption that there is no constitutive connection between the phenomenal and the doxastic, and the second intended to work without this assumption. Pace various luminists, I argue that the appeals to safety needed for Williamson's two-part defence (the first in terms of outright belief, the second in terms of degrees of confidence) are plausible. I also argue that all that is needed to generate the margin-for-error premise from these safety conditions is an empirical assumption about the kinds of creatures we are: that is, creatures whose beliefs are structured by certain dispositions. By recasting the anti-luminosity argument in this way, we can understand what is really at stake in the debate about luminosity: that is, whether we are luminous.},

  abstract = {This article argues that a successful answer to Hume’s problem of induction can be developed from a sub‐genre of philosophy of science known as formal learning theory. One of the central concepts of formal learning theory is logical reliability: roughly, a method is logically reliable when it is assured of eventually settling on the truth for every sequence of data that is possible given what we know. I show that the principle of induction (PI) is necessary and sufficient for logical reliability in what I call simple enumerative induction. This answer to Hume’s problem rests on interpreting PI as a normative claim justified by a non‐empirical epistemic means–ends argument. In such an argument, a rule of inference is shown by mathematical or logical proof to promote a specified epistemic end. Since the proof concerning PI and logical reliability is not based on inductive reasoning, this argument avoids the circularity that Hume argued was inherent in any attempt to justify PI.}

This article revives Rudner’s conclusion, by strengthening both his lines of argument: we generalize his initial assumption regarding the form in which scientists must communicate their results and complete his ‘backup’ argument by appealing to the difference between private and public decisions. Our conclusion that science advisors must, for deep-seated pragmatic reasons, make value judgments is further bolstered by reflections on how the scientific contribution to policy is far less straightforward than the Rudner-style model suggests.},

  abstract = {Why should moral philosophers, moral psychologists, and machine ethicists care about computational complexity? Debates on whether artificial intelligence (AI) can or should be used to solve problems in ethical domains have mainly been driven by what AI can or cannot do in terms of human capacities. In this paper, we tackle the problem from the other end by exploring what kind of moral machines are possible based on what computational systems can or cannot do. To do so, we analyze normative ethics through the lens of computational complexity. First, we introduce computational complexity for the uninitiated reader and discuss how the complexity of ethical problems can be framed within Marr’s three levels of analysis. We then study a range of ethical problems based on consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics, with the aim of elucidating the complexity associated with the problems themselves (e.g., due to combinatorics, uncertainty, strategic dynamics), the computational methods employed (e.g., probability, logic, learning), and the available resources (e.g., time, knowledge, learning). The results indicate that most problems the normative frameworks pose lead to tractability issues in every category analyzed. Our investigation also provides several insights about the computational nature of normative ethics, including the differences between rule- and outcome-based moral strategies, and the implementation-variance with regard to moral resources. We then discuss the consequences complexity results have for the prospect of moral machines in virtue of the tradeoff between optimality and efficiency. Finally, we elucidate how computational complexity can be used to inform both philosophical and cognitive-psychological research on human morality by advancing the moral tractability thesis.},

He makes an epistemological claim about all we can know about objects, not about what objects are, let alone about what objects knowably are. It's true that Hume defines causation as regular succession, but he uses ‘definition’ like his contemporaries Burke and Priestley when they write (respectively): ‘A definition may be very exact, and yet go but a very little way towards informing us of the nature of the thing defined’, and ‘A definition of any particular thing cannot be anything more than an enumeration of its known properties’.},

First, we show that the standard constructions that turn simple determiners into complex quantifiers, namely Boolean operations, iteration, cumulation, and resumption, are tractable. Then, we provide an insight into branching operation yielding intractable natural language multi-quantifier expressions. Next, we focus on a linguistic case study. We use computational complexity results to investigate semantic distinctions between quantified reciprocal sentences. We show a computational dichotomy between different readings of reciprocity. Finally, we go more into philosophical speculation on meaning, ambiguity and computational complexity. In particular, we investigate a possibility of revising the Strong Meaning Hypothesis with complexity aspects to better account for meaning shifts in the domain of multi-quantifier sentences. The paper not only contributes to the field of formal semantics but also illustrates how the tools of computational complexity theory might be successfully used in linguistics and philosophy with an eye towards cognitive science.},

We regard quantifiers that belong to three increasingly more complex classes: Aristotelian (recognizable by 2-state acyclic finite automata), counting (k+2-state finite automata), and proportional quantifiers (pushdown automata). Using regression analysis we show that semantic complexity is a statistically significant factor explaining 27.29\% of frequency variation. We compare this impact to that of other known sources of complexity, both semantic (quantifier monotonicity and the comparative/superlative distinction) and superficial (e.g., the length of quantifier surface forms).

Although the two versions are basically identical, to an extent that is even uncanny, we note more than 400 differences. Several dozen of these are substantive differences due to revisions by Tarski to the Polish version which he did not incorporate in the German version. With respect to these revisions the Polish version should be regarded as more authoritative than the German. Hence scholars limited to an English translation should use ours.},

Multiple factors contribute to the establishment of the human gut microbiota during infancy. Diet is considered as one of the main drivers in shaping the gut microbiota across the life time. Intestinal bacteria play a crucial role in maintaining immune and metabolic homeostasis and protecting against pathogens. Altered gut bacterial composition (dysbiosis) has been associated with the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases and infections. The interpretation of these studies relies on a better understanding of inter-individual variations, heterogeneity of bacterial communities along and across the GI tract, functional redundancy and the need to distinguish cause from effect in states of dysbiosis. This review summarises our current understanding of the development and composition of the human GI microbiota, and its impact on gut integrity and host health, underlying the need for mechanistic studies focusing on host–microbe interactions.},

  abstract = {Adipose tissue is a major regulator of metabolism in health and disease. The prominent roles of adipose tissue are to sequester fatty acids in times of energy excess and to release fatty acids via the process of lipolysis during times of high-energy demand, such as exercise. The fatty acids released during lipolysis are utilized by skeletal muscle to produce adenosine triphosphate to prevent fatigue during prolonged exercise. Lipolysis is controlled by a complex interplay between neuro-humoral regulators, intracellular signaling networks, phosphorylation events involving protein kinase A, translocation of proteins within the cell, and protein–protein interactions. Herein, we describe in detail the cellular and molecular regulation of lipolysis and how these processes are altered by acute exercise. We also explore the processes that underpin adipocyte adaptation to endurance exercise training, with particular focus on epigenetic modifications, control by microRNAs and mitochondrial adaptations. Finally, we examine recent literature describing how exercise might influence the conversion of traditional white adipose tissue to high energy-consuming “brown-like” adipocytes and the implications that this has on whole-body energy balance.},

In this broad sense of the term, it is difficult to deny thatthere are qualia. Disagreement typically centers on which mentalstates have qualia, whether qualia are intrinsic qualities of theirbearers, and how qualia relate to the physical world both inside andoutside the head.

Using the enzymically nondegradable substrate analogues: CnH(2n+1)(0-)OOCH2CH2N+(CH3)3-(H,OH), it is shown that the rather hydrophobic N-terminal sequence of the enzyme, viz., Ala-Leu-Trp-Gln-Phe-Arg, is directly involved in the interaction with the lipid-water interface. Besides hydrophobic probably also polar interactions contribute to the binding process. At neutral or acidic pH the presence of a salt bridge between the N-terminal alpha-NH3+ group and a negatively charged side chain stablizes the interface recognition site and allows the enzyme to penetrate micellar surfaces, even in the absence of metal ion.

This article develops the response that Connectionist models can, and in fact sometimes do, employ compositionally structured representations without, thereby, simply implementing a Classical “Language of Thought.” Focusing on the mode of combination employed in constructing representations, it distinguishes concatenative compositionality, essential to the Classical approach, from a merely functional counterpart increasingly common in Connectionist research. On the basis of this distinction it is possible to demonstrate that Connectionist representations can be compositional without being Classical, and further, that Fodor and Pylyshyn's supposedly conclusive arguments in favor of the Classical approach do not in fact support that approach over the Connectionist alternative (as opposed to an “ossociotionist” straw man).},

This thesis, if true, serves cognitive psychology by constraining the space of computational-level theories of cognition. To utilize this constraint, a precise and workable definition of “computational tractability” is needed. Following computer science tradition, many cognitive scientists and psychologists define computational tractability as polynomial-time computability, leading to the P-Cognition thesis. This article explains how and why the P-Cognition thesis may be overly restrictive, risking the exclusion of veridical computational-level theories from scientific investigation. An argument is made to replace the P-Cognition thesis by the FPT-Cognition thesis as an alternative formalization of the Tractable Cognition thesis (here, FPT stands for fixed-parameter tractable). Possible objections to the Tractable Cognition thesis, and its proposed formalization, are discussed, and existing misconceptions are clarified.},

Some have argued that intractability is a pseudoproblem, however, because cognizers do not actually perform the rational calculations posited by rational models; rather, they only behave as if they do. Whether or not the problem of intractability is dissolved by this gambit critically depends, inter alia, on the semantics of the ‘as if’ connective. First, this paper examines the five most sensible explications in the literature, and concludes that none of them actually circumvents the problem. Hence, rational ‘as if’ explanations must obey the minimal computational constraint of tractability. Second, this paper describes how rational explanations could satisfy the tractability constraint. Our approach suggests a computationally unproblematic interpretation of ‘as if’ that is compatible with the original conception of rational analysis.},

Covering both classical and parameterized complexity analysis, it introduces the mathematical concepts and proof techniques that can be used to test one's intuition of (in)tractability. It also describes how these tools can be applied to cognitive modeling to deal with intractability, and its ramifications, in a systematic way.

I argue that adopting the math-first approach already amounts to a form of structural realism, and that the choice between epistemic and ontic versions of structural realism is then a choice between a language-first and math-first view of metaphysics; I then explore the status of objects (and properties and relations) in fundamental and non-fundamental physics for both versions of math-first structural realism.},

But indefinite extensibility is philosophically puzzling: extant accounts are either metasemantically suspect in requiring mysterious mechanisms of domain expansion, or metaphysically suspect in requiring nonstandard assumptions about mathematical objects. Happily, the view of quantifier meanings that underwrites quantifier variance can be used to provide an account of indefinite extensibility that is both metasemantically and metaphysically satisfying. Section 1 introduces the puzzle of indefinite extensibility; section 2 develops and clarifies the metasemantics of quantifier variance; section 3 solves section 1's puzzle of indefinite extensibility by applying section 2's account of quantifier meanings; and section 4 compares the theory developed in section 3 to several other theories in the literature.},

Next I critically examine recent approaches by Okasha, Godfrey-Smith, Schramm, and Freitag. All of these approaches have their virtues, but none of them rules out every problem case. Nor do any of them alone explain exactly what goes wrong in all types of gruesome reasoning. My account aims to do both. Learning lessons from my criticisms of previous theories, I argue that there are several crucial types of independence. Correct characterizations of all of them are needed to rule out every problem case.

  abstract = {Objective Since 2010, England has experienced relative constraints in public expenditure on healthcare (PEH) and social care (PES). We sought to determine whether these constraints have affected mortality rates. Methods We collected data on health and social care resources and finances for England from 2001 to 2014. Time trend analyses were conducted to compare the actual mortality rates in 2011–2014 with the counterfactual rates expected based on trends before spending constraints. Fixed-effects regression analyses were conducted using annual data on PES and PEH with mortality as the outcome, with further adjustments for macroeconomic factors and resources. Analyses were stratified by age group, place of death and lower-tier local authority (n=325). Mortality rates to 2020 were projected based on recent trends. Results Spending constraints between 2010 and 2014 were associated with an estimated 45 368 (95\% CI 34 530 to 56 206) higher than expected number of deaths compared with pre-2010 trends. Deaths in those aged ≥60 and in care homes accounted for the majority. PES was more strongly linked with care home and home mortality than PEH, with each £10 per capita decline in real PES associated with an increase of 5.10 (3.65–6.54) (p{$<$}0.001) care home deaths per 100 000. These associations persisted in lag analyses and after adjustment for macroeconomic factors. Furthermore, we found that changes in real PES per capita may be linked to mortality mostly via changes in nurse numbers. Projections to 2020 based on 2009-2014 trend was cumulatively linked to an estimated 152 141 (95\% CI 134 597 and 169 685) additional deaths. Conclusions Spending constraints, especially PES, are associated with a substantial mortality gap. We suggest that spending should be targeted on improving care delivered in care homes and at home; and maintaining or increasing nurse numbers.},

  abstract = {Logical paradoxes – like the Liar, Russell's, and the Sorites – are notorious. But in Paradoxes and Inconsistent Mathematics, it is argued that they are only the noisiest of many. Contradictions arise in the everyday, from the smallest points to the widest boundaries. In this book, Zach Weber uses “dialetheic paraconsistency” – a formal framework where some contradictions can be true without absurdity – as the basis for developing this idea rigorously, from mathematical foundations up. In doing so, Weber directly addresses a longstanding open question: how much standard mathematics can paraconsistency capture? The guiding focus is on a more basic question, of why there are paradoxes. Details underscore a simple philosophical claim: that paradoxes are found in the ordinary, and that is what makes them so extraordinary.},

I) has received surprisingly little scholarly attention. It is scarcely known to art historians. The aim of this paper is to draw attention to the emblem on the reverse of the issue, and to offer an hypothesis on its meaning. Discovered ‘some years’ before 1844 with other gold coins – looped for suspension as if for a necklace of medalets – and jewellery in or near the churchyard of St Martin's, Canterbury, and published in 1845, the medalet recently has been convincingly assigned to a group of grave goods deposited c. 580–90. Besides the coin in question, the group included an Italian tremissis of Justin II, a Germanic tremissis of unsure origin, a Merovingian solidus struck by Leudulf at Ivegio vico and two tremisses from southern France, the first from Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges, the second from Agen. Today these objects are in Liverpool, and Philip Grierson has persuasively argued for the inclusion of a Merovingian tremissis in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, as once forming part of the deposit. Most likely all the coins of the Canterbury group were issued during the second half of the sixth century.},

Trials that uncover corruption in high places, affect electoral fortunes, or cause a political supporter to pay large sums of money often test the willingness to delegate power to a court. In any context, including democracies, executive branches and legislatures may occasionally attempt to infringe judicial independence when there are strong incentives to do so. The issue is, first, whether they succeed in influencing the outcomes of these particular cases, and, second, whether their efforts undermine the ideal of neutral third-party dispute resolution for future controversies. We may be able to learn something about the development of institutional autonomy by comparing country experiences. In highly charged disputes, why do executive branch efforts to influence outcomes end with the judiciary substantially intact in some instances, whereas in others the autonomy of the court from the other branches of government diminishes?In the context of this discussion, judicial independence means freedom from partisan influence in particular cases. There are many ways in which a determined executive faction may secure the outcomes it wishes short of threatening or firing judges, packing the court, or ousting jurisdiction – the three most spectacular ways to abrogate the independence of the judiciary.},

Once this misstep in the experiment is made explicit, individualism emerges as a much stronger position than it is usually taken to be. Questioning the assumption that the patient uttering ‘I have arthritis in my thigh’ makes a conceptual error makes it possible for the individualist to grant Burge the claim that the patient has the standard concept of arthritis, rather than his own deviant concept, and yet avoid the social externalist conclusions.},

  abstract = {Gut microbiome diversity has been strongly associated with mood-relating behaviours, including major depressive disorder (MDD). This association stems from the recently characterised bi-directional communication system between the gut and the brain, mediated by neuroimmune, neuroendocrine and sensory neural pathways. While the link between gut microbiome and depression is well supported by research, a major question needing to be addressed is the causality in the connection between the two, which will support the understanding of the role that the gut microbiota play in depression. In this article, we address this question by examining a theoretical ‘chronology’, reviewing the evidence supporting two possible sequences of events. First, we discuss that alterations in the gut microbiota populations of specific species might contribute to depression, and secondly, that depressive states might induce modification of specific gut microbiota species and eventually contribute to more severe depression. The feasibility of both sequences is supported by pre-clinical trials. For instance, research in rodents has shown an onset of depressive behaviour following faecal transplantations from patients with MDD. On the other hand, mental induction of stress and depressive behaviour in rodents resulted in reduced gut microbiota richness and diversity. Synthesis of these chronology dynamics raises important research directions to further understand the role that gut microbiota play in mood-relating behaviours, which holds substantial potential clinical outcomes for persons who experience MDD or related depressive disorders.},

This is a dark and difficult age, where hard evidence is rare, but glittering and richly varied: 'myths, king-lists, placenames, sagas, settlements, runic inscriptions, palaces, belt-buckles, post-holes, middens and graves, ' says the editor, 'are all grist to our mill.'. This volume celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the discovery of that most famous burial of the early middle ages: the great treasure now in the British Museum, unearthed from the centre of a ninety-foot-long ship buried in the sand beneath a mound on remote Suffolk heathland at Sutton Hoo. It also marks the end of the major campaign of excavations carried out there over the past decade, which involved the widest possible range of disciplines. The scholars whose work is gathered here represent, together with Martin Carver's concluding chapter summarising the results of the latest excavations, the current state of knowledge about this extraordinary site; that it still has secrets to reveal is shown by the last-minute discovery of a striking burial of a young noble with his horse and grave goods.},

  abstract = {The main argument for scientific realism is that our present theories in science are so successful empirically that they can't have got that way by chance — instead they must somehow have latched onto the blueprint of the universe. The main argument against scientific realism is that there have been enormously successful theories which were once accepted but are now regarded as false. The central question addressed in this paper is whether there is some reasonable way to have the best of both worlds: to give the argument from scientific revolutions its full weight and yet still adopt some sort of realist attitude towards presently accepted theories in physics and elsewhere. I argue that there is such a way — through structural realism, a position adopted by Poincaré, and here elaborated and defended. L'argument principal en faveur du réalisme scientifique, c'est que nos théories scientifiques actuelles sont empiriquement si efficaces que cela ne peut pas être dû au hasard — on doit en quelque sorte avoir découvert les plans de l'univers. L'argument principal contre le réalisme scientifique, c'est qu'il y a eu des théories scientifiques massivement efficaces qui ont été autrefois tenues pour vraies mais sont considérées aujourd'hui comme fausses. La principale question traitée dans ce papier, c'est s'il y a un moyen raisonnable de prendre le meilleur des deux mondes: de donner tout son poids à l'argument tiré des révolutions scientifiques et d'adopter pourtant une sorte d'attitude réaliste à l'égard des théories actuellement acceptées en physique ou ailleurs. Je montre qu'une telle voie existe: le réalisme structurel, une position adoptée par Poincaré, que je défends et développe ici. Das Hauptargument für wissenschaftlichen Realismus ist, dass unsere gegenwärtigen Theorien in der Wissenschaft empirisch so erfolgreich sind, dass sie nicht zufälligerweise so geworden sein können — statt dessen müssen sie irgendwie mit dem Plan des Universums übereinstimmen. Das Hauptargument gegen den wissenschaftlichen Realismus ist, dass es ausgesprochen erfolgreiche Theorien gegeben hat, die einmal akzeptiert gewesen waren, aber jetzt als falsch betrachtet werden. Die in diesem Papier behandelte Kernfrage lautet, ob es einen vernünftigen Weg gibt, aus beiden Welten das Beste zu haben: dem Argument vom Vorhandensein wissenschaftlicher Revolutionen sein volles Gewicht zu geben und dennoch eine Art von realistischer Einstellung gegenüber den heute in der Physik und anderswo akzeptierten Theorien einzunehmen. Ich argumentiere, dass es einen solchen Weg gibt — durch den von Poincaré übernommenen strukturellen Realismus, der hier ausgearbeitet und verteidigt wird.},

In order to assess it objectively and put forward recommendations for future development, this paper first develops a four-dimensional Urbanization Quality Index using weights calculated by the Deviation Maximization Method for a comprehensive assessment and then reveals the spatial association of China\&rsquo;s urbanization by Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis. The study leads to three major findings. First, the urbanization quality in China has gradually increased over time, but there have been significant differences between regions. Second, the four aspects of urbanization quality have shown the following trends: (i) the quality of urban development has steadily increased; (ii) the sustainability of urban development has shown a downward trend in recent years; (iii) the efficiency of urbanization improved before 2006 but then declined slightly due to capital, land use, and resource efficiency constraints; (IV) the urban\&ndash;rural integration deteriorated in the early years but then improved over time. Third, although the urbanization quality has a significantly positive global spatial autocorrelation, the local spatial autocorrelation varies between eastern and western regions. Based on these findings, this paper concludes with policy recommendations for improving urbanization quality and its sustainability in China.},

  abstract = {Bamboo, a fast-growing grass, has a higher strength-to-weight ratio than steel and concrete. The unique properties of bamboo come from the natural composite structure of fibers that consists mainly of cellulose microfibrils in a matrix of intertwined hemicellulose and lignin called lignin-carbohydrate complex (LCC). Here, we have used atomistic simulations to study the mechanical properties of and adhesive interactions between the materials in bamboo fibers. With this aim, we have developed molecular models of lignin, hemicellulose and LCC structures to study the elastic moduli and the adhesion energies between these materials and cellulose microfibril faces. Good agreement was observed between the simulation results and experimental data. It was also shown that the hemicellulose model has stronger mechanical properties than lignin while lignin exhibits greater tendency to adhere to cellulose microfibrils. The study suggests that the abundance of hydrogen bonds in hemicellulose chains is responsible for improving the mechanical behavior of LCC. The strong van der Waals forces between lignin molecules and cellulose microfibril is responsible for higher adhesion energy between LCC and cellulose microfibrils. We also found out that the amorphous regions of cellulose microfibrils are the weakest interfaces in bamboo fibrils. Hence, they determine the fibril strength.},

  abstract = {The time separation results concerning classes of languages over a single-letter alphabet accepted by multi-tape nondeterministic Turing machines, well-known from Seiferas, Fischer and Meyer (1978), are supplemented. Moreover, via a universal machine a modified time complexity measure UTIME of Turing machines computations which is sensitive to multiplication by constants (i.e., UTIME(t) ⊊ UTIME(kt), where UTIME(t) is the class of languages of complexity not larger than t) is introduced. On the level of this measure, the results concerning languages over one- and two-letter alphabets are refined. The proof tools are versions of a translational diagonalization and of an unpadding technique.},

  abstract = {One of the major applications of tissue-engineered skin substitutes for wound healing is to promote the healing of cutaneous wounds. In this respect, many important clinical milestones have been reached in the past decades. However, currently available skin substitutes for wound healing often suffer from a range of problems including wound contraction, scar formation, and poor integration with host tissue. Engineering skin substitutes by tissue engineering approach has relied upon the creation of three-dimensional scaffolds as extracellular matrix (ECM) analog to guide cell adhesion, growth, and differentiation to form skin-functional and structural tissue. The three-dimensional scaffolds can not only cover wound and give a physical barrier against external infection as wound dressing, but also can provide support both for dermal fibroblasts and the overlying keratinocytes for skin tissue engineering. A successful tissue scaffold should exhibit appropriate physical and mechanical characteristics and provide an appropriate surface chemistry and nano and microstructures to facilitate cellular attachment, proliferation, and differentiation. A variety of scaffolds have been fabricated based on materials ranging from naturally occurring ones to those manufactured synthetically. This review discusses a variety of commercial or laboratory-engineered skin substitutes for wound healing. Central to the discussion are the scaffolds/materials, fabrication techniques, and their characteristics associated with wound healing. One specifically highlighted emerging fabrication technique is electrospinning that allows the design and fabrication of biomimetic scaffolds that offer tremendous potential applications in wound healing of skin.
