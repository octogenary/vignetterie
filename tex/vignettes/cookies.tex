Fresh cookies on demand.

Out of laziness, I copy Felicity Cloake’s \href{https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jun/15/how-to-make-chocolate-chip-cookies-recipe-felicity-cloake}{cookie recipe} (cutting 20–40 per cent of the sugar depending on whether I expect guests). One way to keep these ready on demand is to freeze the dough; one can then extract it with a heat conducting ice cream scoop, kneed it a little, and then put it in the oven.
