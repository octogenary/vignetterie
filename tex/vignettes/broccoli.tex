Crispy purple broccoli.

recettes
===
\begin{enumerate}
\item    Cut and wash the broccoli.
\item    Dry it. In the absence of a salad spinner, it is possible to dry it with several towels. First: wrap all the broccoli in a towel and then shake the towel vigorously, until the towel is so wet that it is no longer drying the broccoli. Repeat two or three times with fresh towels.Second: place all the broccoli on a towel (without stacking) and leave for a few hours. A fan helps.
\item    Drizzle oil over the broccoli, and pour garlic powder, chilli (and, optionally, anchovies) over it.
\item    Distribute the broccoli (as loosely as possible) over a tray and leave in the oven at 160C fan until dry. (It usually takes twenty minutes for me.)
