‘The day of refusal to obey an order’.

In 1989, Amos Oz stated that if the idea of ‘expulsion and exile of the Arabs’ is ever raised, principled Israelis must make it clear that they will not permit this: ‘We will not let you expel the Arabs even if we have to divide the state and the army, even if we have to lie under the wheels of the trucks.’ One year later, Yair Tzaban and Yossi Sarid wrote in Yedioth Ahronoth that ‘the day the transfer order, which is patently illegal, is given shall also be the day of refusal to obey an order.’
