Lentils for the garlic-addled.

Pre-heat the oven to 150C or so. Soften garlic, shallots, onion, and chilli (or perhaps peppercorns) with thyme and parsley in a dutch oven. For each 200 grammes of lentils to be included, pour in a tin of tomatoes; for each 400 grammes, ½ litre of stock. Then pour in the lentils (puy or green work). Leave in the oven for about 50 minutes.

I find this goes quite well with couscous and spinach: cook the couscous for ⅔ the cooking time recommended, quickly blanch the spinach, drain, then reheat the lentils until bubbling.
