The Levesque–van Em Boas invariance thesis.

===
The \emph{invariance thesis} \parencites[see][\S~1.3.1]{arora2009}[\S~2.2]{dean2021}[\S~1]{vanemdeboas1991}[\S~3]{levesque1988} that ‘[t]here exists a standard class of machine models…[that] simulate each other with Polynomially bounded overhead in time and constant factor overhead in space’ appears to have been partially anticipated by \textcite[\S~3]{levesque1988}.

	\emph{Turing complexity thesis.} Anything that can be computed at all can be computed by a Turing machine \emph{with at most a polynomial slowdown.}
	
	\ldots{} \emph{Corollary.} Anything that a Turing machine cannot calculate in polynomial time cannot be calculated \emph{at all} in polynomial time.
