The \emph{invariance thesis} \parencites[see][§ 1.3.1]{arora2009}[§ 2.2]{dean2021}[§ 1]{vanemdeboas1991}[§ 1]{levesque1988} that ‘[t]here exists a standard class of machine models…[that] simulate each other with Polynomially bounded overhead in time and constant factor overhead in space’ appears to have been partially anticipated by \textcite[§ 3]{levesque1988}.
\begin{quote}
	\emph{Turing complexity thesis.} Anything that can be computed at all can be computed by a Turing machine \emph{with at most a polynomial slowdown.}
	
	\ldots{} \emph{Corollary.} Anything that a Turing machine cannot calculate in polynomial time cannot be calculated \emph{at all} in polynomial time.
