South Africa, ANC, Paul Mashatile

The two most noteworthy things that have involved Mashatile during this period have both been negative. First, there was the “assassination attempt” on the DP in April, during which his car was allegedly shot at – an incident shrouded in mystery because it appears that almost nobody in the ANC believes it actually happened, with the conspiracy theory there being that Mashatile was hoping for a Donald Trump-style post-assassination popularity surge. If so, it didn’t work; one of the only groups to express real concern was the EFF leadership, which is so strange in itself that it greatly fortified theories that a Mashatile presidency would see the EFF elevated to hitherto unrealised heights of political power.
