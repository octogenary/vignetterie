Lentils with sausages.

For \(x\) portions, preheat the oven to 180C; soften first a quantity to taste of garlic, shallots, onions, and chilli, in a large casserole (for me, usually a large bulb of garlic, shallot, and onion for three to six portions is right), then \(100x\) (combined) grammes of celery and carrot; when softened and slightly browned, pour in about \(100x\) ml of fresh chicken stock or equivalent, rinse \(100x\) grammes of lentils under the tap and then pour in, quickly add a suitable number of sausages, and place in the oven. After about forty minutes, flip the sausages. After about fifty minutes, set the oven to grill, to brown the other side of the sausages and the lentils, and remove before the hour elapses. Freezes well, and defrosts overnight.
