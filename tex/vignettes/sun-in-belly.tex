Look, what do you want to convey in this film?

Er, I don’t know. It’s a very difficult question. Er, I make films, to express myself, to show myself, to show other people, perhaps something more than myself. Perhaps it is the sun in the belly.

From \citetitle{sastry1968}.

\citetitle{sastry1972} is less known than \citetitle{sastry1967}, which elicited much coverage when rediscovered on the internet many years later.

Sastry also produced more ‘official’ films \parencites*[e.g.][]{sastry1973}{sastry1973a}. I rarely know what to make of the balance between his subversive tendencies (on display at least in the three films above) and the official side. I doubt either he or his superiors really knew either.
